  abstract	= {Phishing is the practice of eliciting a person's
		  confidential information such as name, date of birth or
		  credit card details. Typically, the phishers use simple
		  technologies (e.g., e-mailing) to spread social engineering
		  attacks with the goal of persuading a large amount of
		  victims into voluntarily disclose sensitive data. Phishing
		  based on e-mail and web technologies is certainly the most
		  popular form. It has indeed received ample attention and
		  some mitigation measures have been implemented. In this
		  paper we describe our study on vishing (voice phishing), a
		  form of phishing where the scammers exploit the phone
		  channel to ask for sensitive information, rather than
		  sending e-mails and cloning trustworthy websites. In some
		  sense, the traditional ala-Mitnick phone scams are
		  streamlined by attackers using techniques that are typical
		  of modern, e-mail-based phishing. We detail our analysis of
		  an embryonic, real-world database of vishing attacks
		  reported by victims through a publicly-available web
		  application that we build for this purpose. The vishing
		  activity that we registered in our preliminary analysis is
		  targeted against the U.S. customers. According to our
		  samples, we analyzed to what extent the criminals rely on
		  automated responders to streamline the vishing campaigns.
		  In addition, we analyzed the content of the conversations
		  and found that words such as ``credit'', ``press'' (a key)
		  or ``account'' are fairly popular. In addition, we describe
		  the data collection infrastructure and motivate why
		  gathering data about vishing is more difficult than for
		  regular e-mail phishing.},
