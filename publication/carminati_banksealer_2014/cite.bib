  abstract	= {We propose a semi-supervised online banking fraud analysis
		  and decision support approach. During a training phase, it
		  builds a profile for each customer based on past
		  transactions. At runtime, it supports the analyst by
		  ranking unforeseen transactions that deviate from the
		  learned profiles. It uses methods whose output has a
		  immediate statistical meaning that provide the analyst with
		  an easy-to-understand model of each customer's spending
		  habits. First, we quantify the anomaly of each transaction
		  with respect to the customer historical profile. Second, we
		  find global clusters of customers with similar spending
		  habits. Third, we use a temporal threshold system that
		  measures the anomaly of the current spending pattern of
		  each customer, with respect to his or her past spending
		  behavior. As a result, we mitigate the undertraining due to
		  the lack of historical data for building of well-trained
		  profiles (of fresh users), and the users that change their
		  (spending) habits over time. Our evaluation on real-world
		  data shows that our approach correctly ranks complex frauds
		  as ``top priority''.},
