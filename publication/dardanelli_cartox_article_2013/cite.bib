  abstract	= {Modern vehicles are increasingly being interconnected with
		  computer systems, which collect information both from
		  vehicular sources and Internet services. Unfortunately,
		  this creates a non negligible attack surface, which extends
		  when vehicles are partly operated via smartphones. In this
		  letter, a hierarchically distributed control system
		  architecture which integrates a smartphone with classical
		  embedded systems is presented, and an ad-hoc, end-to-end
		  security layer is designed to demonstrate how a smartphone
		  can interact securely with a modern vehicle without
		  requiring modifications to the existing in-vehicle network.
		  Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
		  approach.},
