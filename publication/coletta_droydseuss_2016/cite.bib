  abstract	= {After analyzing several Android mobile banking trojans, we
		  observed the presence of repetitive artifacts that describe
		  valuable information about the distribution of this class
		  of malicious apps. Motivated by the high threat level posed
		  by mobile banking trojans and by the lack of publicly
		  available analysis and intelligence tools, we automated the
		  extraction of such artifacts and created a malware tracker
		  named DroydSeuss. DroydSeuss first processes applications
		  both statically and dynamically, extracting relevant
		  strings that contain traces of communication endpoints.
		  Second, it prioritizes the extracted strings based on the
		  APIs that manipulate them. Finally, DroydSeuss correlates
		  the endpoints with descriptive metadata from the samples,
		  providing aggregated statistics, raw data, and cross-sample
		  information that allow researchers to pinpoint relevant
		  groups of applications. We connected DroydSeuss to the
		  VirusTotal daily feed, consuming Android samples that
		  perform banking-trojan activity. We manually analyzed its
		  output and found supporting evidence to confirm its
		  correctness. Remarkably, the most frequent itemset unveiled
		  a campaign currently spreading against Chinese and Korean
		  bank customers.
		  
		  Although motivated by mobile banking trojans, DroydSeuss
		  can be used to analyze the communication behavior of any
		  suspicious application.},
