  abstract	= {Taint-style vulnerabilities comprise a majority of fuzzer
		  discovered program faults. These vulnerabilities usually
		  manifest as memory access violations caused by tainted
		  program input. Although fuzzers have helped uncover a
		  majority of taint-style vulnerabilities in software to
		  date, they are limited by (i) extent of test coverage; and
		  (ii) the availability of fuzzable test cases. Therefore,
		  fuzzing alone cannot provide a high assurance that all
		  taint-style vulnerabilities have been uncovered.
		  
		  In this paper, we use static template matching to find
		  recurrences of fuzzer-discovered vulnerabilities. To
		  compensate for the inherent incompleteness of template
		  matching, we implement a simple yet effective match-ranking
		  algorithm that uses test coverage data to focus attention
		  on matches comprising untested code. We prototype our
		  approach using the Clang/LLVM compiler toolchain and use it
		  in conjunction with afl-fuzz, a modern coverage-guided
		  fuzzer. Using a case study carried out on the Open vSwitch
		  codebase, we show that our prototype uncovers corner cases
		  in modules that lack a fuzzable test harness. Our work
		  demonstrates that static analysis can effectively
		  complement fuzz testing, and is a useful addition to the
		  security assessment tool-set. Furthermore, our techniques
		  hold promise for increasing the effectiveness of program
		  analysis and testing, and serve as a building block for a
		  hybrid vulnerability discovery framework.},
