  abstract	= {The world of information and communication technology is
		  experiencing changes that, regardless of some skepticism,
		  are bringing to life the concept of ``utility computing''.
		  The nostalgics observed a parallel between the emerging
		  paradigm of cloud computing and the traditional
		  time-sharing era, depicting clouds as the modern
		  reincarnation of mainframes available on a pay-per-use
		  basis, and equipped with virtual, elastic, paid
		  disks-as-a-service that replace the old physical disks with
		  quotas. This comparison is fascinating, but more
		  importantly, in our opinion, it prepares the ground for
		  constructive critiques regarding the security of such
		  computing paradigm. In this paper we explore similar
		  analogies to discuss our position about the current
		  countermeasures (e.g., intrusion detection systems,
		  anti-viruses), developed to mitigate well-known security
		  threats. By reasoning on said affinities, we focus on the
		  simple case of anomaly-based approaches, which are employed
		  in many modern protection tools, not just in intrusion
		  detectors. We illustrate our position by the means of a
		  simple running example and show that attacks against
		  injection vulnerabilities, a current menace that is easily
		  recognizable with ordinary anomaly-based checks, can be
		  difficult to detect if web services are assumed to be
		  regular web applications. Along this line, we concentrate
		  on a few, critical hypotheses that demand particular
		  attention. We conclude that, although only a minority of
		  threats qualify as novel, they are well camouflaged and can
		  be difficult to recognize behind the confusion caused by
		  the cloud computing excitement.},
