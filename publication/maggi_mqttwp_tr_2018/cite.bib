  abstract	= {The most popular protocols for machine-tomachine (M2M)
		  technology---the backbone of the internet of things (IoT)
		  and industrial internet of things (IIoT)---are affected by
		  security and privacy issues that impact several market
		  verticals, applications, products, and brands.
		  
		  This report provides a holistic security analysis of the
		  most popular M2M protocols: Message Queuing Telemetry
		  Transport (MQTT) and Constrained Application Protocol
		  (CoAP). Given their flexibility, these data protocols are
		  being adopted in a variety of settings for consumer,
		  enterprise, and industrial applications to connect
		  practically all kinds of “machine,” from innocuous
		  fitness trackers to large power plants. We found issues in
		  design as well as vulnerable implementations, along with
		  hundreds of thousands of unsecure deployments. These issues
		  highlight the risk of how endpoints could be open to
		  denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and, in some cases, taken
		  advantage of to gain full control by an attacker. Despite
		  the fixes in the design specifications, it is hard for
		  developers to keep up with a changing standard when a
		  technology becomes pervasive. Also, the market for this
		  technology is very wide because the barrier to entry is
		  fairly low. This has led to a multitude of fragmented
		  implementations.
		  
		  This report is aimed at raising security awareness and
		  driving the adoption of proper remediation measures.},
