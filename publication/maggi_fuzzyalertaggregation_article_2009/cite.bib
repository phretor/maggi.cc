  abstract	= {In this paper we focus on the aggregation of IDS alerts,
		  an important component of the alert fusion process. We
		  exploit fuzzy measures and fuzzy sets to design simple and
		  robust alert aggregation algorithms. Exploiting fuzzy sets,
		  we are able to robustly state whether or not two alerts are
		  ``close in time'', dealing with noisy and delayed
		  detections. A performance metric for the evaluation of
		  fusion systems is also proposed. Finally, we evaluate the
		  fusion method with alert streams from anomaly-based IDS.},
