  abstract	= {Building automation systems rely heavily on
		  general-purpose computers and communication protocols,
		  which are often affected by security vulnerabilities. In
		  this paper, we first analyze the attack surface of a real
		  building automation system - based on the widely used KNX
		  protocol-connected to a general-purpose IP network. To this
		  end, we analyze the vulnerabilities of KNX-based networks
		  highlighted by previous research work, which, however, did
		  not corroborate their findings with experimental results.
		  To verify the practical exploitability of these
		  vulnerabilities and their potential impact, we implement a
		  full-fledged testbed infrastructure that reproduces the
		  typical deployment of a building automation system. On this
		  testbed, we show the feasibility of a practical attack that
		  leverages and combines the aforementioned vulnerabilities.
		  We show the ease of reverse engineering the vendor-specific
		  components of the KNX protocol. Our attack leverages the
		  IP-to-KNX connectivity to send arbitrary commands which are
		  executed by the actuators. We conclude that the
		  vulnerabilities highlighted by previous work are
		  effectively exploitable in practice, with severe results.
		  Although we use KNX as a target, our work can be
		  generalized to other communication protocols, often
		  characterized by similar issues. Finally, we analyze the
		  countermeasures proposed in previous literature and reveal
		  the limitations that prevent their adoption in practice. We
		  suggest a practical stopgap measure to protect real
		  KNX-based BASs from our attack.},
