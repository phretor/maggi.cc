  abstract	= {Phishers nowadays rely on a variety of channels, ranging
		  from old-fashioned emails to instant messages, social
		  networks, and the phone system (with both calls and text
		  messages), with the goal of reaching more victims. As a
		  consequence, modern phishing became a multi-faceted, even
		  more pervasive threat that is inherently more difficult to
		  study than traditional, email-based phishing. This short
		  paper describes the status of a data collection system we
		  are developing to capture different aspects of phishing
		  campaigns, with a particular focus on the emerging use of
		  the voice channel. The general approach is to record
		  inbound calls received on decoy phone lines, place outbound
		  calls to the same caller identifiers (when available) and
		  also to telephone numbers obtained from different sources.
		  Specifically, our system analyzes instant messages (e.g.,
		  automated social engineering attempts) and suspicious
		  emails (e.g., spam, phishing), and extracts telephone
		  numbers, URLs and popular words from the content. In
		  addition, users can voluntarily submit voice phishing
		  (vishing) attempts through a public website. Extracted
		  telephone numbers, URLs and popular words will be
		  correlated to recognize campaigns by means of cross-channel
		  relationships between messages.},
