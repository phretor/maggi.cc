  abstract	= {When analyzing an untrusted binary, reverse engineers
		  usually rely on ad-hoc collections of interesting dynamic
		  patterns known as behaviors in the malware-analysis
		  community and static patterns known as signatures in the
		  antivirus community. Such patterns are often part of the
		  skill set of the analyst, sometimes implemented in
		  manually-created post-processing scripts. It would be
		  desirable to be able to automatically find such behaviors,
		  present them to analysts, and create a systematic catalog
		  of matching rules and relevant implementations. We propose
		  Jackdaw, a system that finds interesting dynamic patterns,
		  and ranks them to unveil potentially interesting behaviors.
		  Then, it annotates them with static information, capturing
		  the distinct implementations of each across different
		  malware families. Finally, Jackdaw associates semantic
		  information to the behaviors, so as to create a descriptive
		  summary that helps the analysts in querying the catalog of
		  behaviors by type. To do this, it leverages the dynamic
		  information and an indexed Web-based knowledge databases.
		  We implement and demonstrate Jackdaw on the Win32 API (even
		  if the technique can be generalized to any OS). On a
		  dataset of 2,136 distinct binaries, including both
		  malicious and benign libraries and executables, we compared
		  the behaviors extracted automatically against a ground
		  truth of 44 behaviors created manually by expert analysts.
		  Jackdaw found 77.3% of them and was able to exclude
		  spurious behaviors in 99.6% cases. We also discovered 466
		  novel behaviors, among which manual exploration and review
		  by expert reverse engineers revealed interesting findings
		  and confirmed the correctness of the semantic tagging.},
