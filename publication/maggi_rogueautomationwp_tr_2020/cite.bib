  abstract	= {In this research paper, we reveal previously unknown
		  design flaws that malicious actors could exploit to hide
		  malicious functionalities in industrial robots and other
		  automated, programmable manufacturing machines. Since these
		  flaws are difficult to fix, enterprises that deploy
		  vulnerable machines could face serious consequences. An
		  attacker could exploit them to become persistent within a
		  smart factory, silently alter the quality of products, halt
		  a manufacturing line, or perform some other malicious
		  activity.},
