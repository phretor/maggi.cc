  abstract	= {Mobile devices have become the main interaction mean
		  between users and the surrounding environment. An indirect
		  measure of this trend is the increasing amount of security
		  threats against mobile devices, which in turn created a
		  demand for protection tools. Protection tools,
		  unfortunately, add an additional burden for the
		  smartphone's battery power, which is a precious resource.
		  This observation motivates the need for smarter (security)
		  applications, designed and capable of running within
		  adaptive energy goals. Although this problem affects other
		  areas, in the security area this research direction is
		  referred to as "green security". In general, a fundamental
		  need to the researches toward creating energy-aware
		  applications, consist in having appropriate power models
		  that capture the full dynamic of devices and users. This is
		  not an easy task because of the highly dynamic environment
		  and usage habits. In practice, this goal requires easy
		  mechanisms to measure the power consumption and approaches
		  to create accurate models. The existing approaches that
		  tackle this problem are either not accurate or not
		  applicable in practice due to their limiting requirements.
		  We propose MPower, a power-sensing platform and adaptive
		  power modeling platform for Android mobile devices. The
		  MPower approach creates an adequate and precise knowledge
		  base of the power "behavior" of several different devices
		  and users, which allows us to create better device-centric
		  power models that considers the main hardware components
		  and how they contributed to the overall power consumption.
		  In this paper we consolidate our perspective work on MPower
		  by providing the implementation details and evaluation on
		  278 users and about 22.5 million power-related data. Also,
		  we explain how MPower is useful in those scenarios where
		  low-power, unobtrusive, accurate power modeling is
		  necessary (e.g., green security applications).},
