  abstract	= {Industrial robots, automated manufacturing, and efficient
		  logistics processes are at the heart of the upcoming fourth
		  industrial revolution. While there are seminal studies on
		  the vulnerabilities of cyber-physical systems in the
		  industry, as of today there has been no systematic analysis
		  of the security of industrial robot controllers. We examine
		  the standard architecture of an industrial robot and
		  analyze a concrete deployment from a systems security
		  standpoint. Then, we propose an attacker model and confront
		  it with the minimal set of requirements that industrial
		  robots should honor: precision in sensing the environment,
		  correctness in execution of control logic, and safety for
		  human operators. Following an experimental and practical
		  approach, we then show how our modeled attacker can subvert
		  such requirements through the exploitation of software
		  vulnerabilities, leading to severe consequences that are
		  unique to the robotics domain. We conclude by discussing
		  safety standards and security challenges in industrial
		  robotics.},
