  abstract	= {This research presents a systematic security analysis that
		  we performed to explore a variety of attack vectors on a
		  real smart manufacturing system and to assess the attacks
		  that could be feasibly launched on a complex smart
		  manufacturing system. The main, two-pronged question we
		  want to answer is: Under which threat conditions and
		  attacker capabilities are certain attacks possible, and
		  what are the consequences?},
