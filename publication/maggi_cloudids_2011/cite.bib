  abstract	= {The world of information and communication technology is
		  experiencing changes that, regardless of some skepticism,
		  are bringing to life the concept of ``utility computing''.
		  The nostalgics observed a parallel between the emerging
		  paradigm of cloud computing and the traditional
		  time-sharing era, depicting clouds as the modern
		  reincarnation of mainframes available on a pay-per-use
		  basis, and equipped with virtual, elastic,
		  disks-as-a-service that replace the old physical disks with
		  quotas. This comparison is fascinating, but more
		  importantly, in our opinion, it prepares the ground for
		  constructive critiques regarding the security of such a
		  computing paradigm and, especially, one of its key
		  components: web services. In this paper we discuss our
		  position about the current countermeasures (e.g., intrusion
		  detection systems, anti-malware), developed to mitigate
		  well-known web security threats. By reasoning on said
		  affinities, we focus on the simple case study of
		  anomaly-based approaches, which are employed in many modern
		  protection tools, not just in intrusion detectors. We
		  illustrate our position by the means of a simple running
		  example and show that attacks against injection
		  vulnerabilities, a widespread menace that is easily
		  recognizable with ordinary anomaly-based checks, can be
		  difficult to detect if web services are protected as they
		  were regular web applications. Along this line, we
		  concentrate on a few, critical hypotheses that demand
		  particular attention. Although in this emerging landscape
		  only a minority of threats qualify as novel, they could be
		  difficult to recognize with the current countermeasures and
		  thus can expose web services to new attacks. We conclude by
		  proposing simple modifications to the current
		  countermeasures to cope with the aforesaid security
		  issues.},
