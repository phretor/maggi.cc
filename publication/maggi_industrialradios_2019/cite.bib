  abstract	= {Heavy industrial machinery is a primary asset for the
		  operation of key sectors such as construction,
		  manufacturing, and logistics. Targeted attacks against
		  these assets could result in incidents, fatal injuries, and
		  substantial financial loss. Given the importance of such
		  scenarios, we analyzed and evaluated the security
		  implications of the technology used to operate and control
		  this machinery, namely industrial radio remote controllers.
		  We conducted the first-ever security analysis of this
		  technology, which relies on proprietary radio-frequency
		  protocols to implement remote-control functionalities.
		  Through a two-phase evaluation approach we discovered
		  important flaws in the design and implementation of
		  industrial remote controllers. In this paper we introduce
		  and describe 5 practical attacks affecting major vendors
		  and multiple real-world installations. We conclude by
		  discussing how a challenging responsible disclosure process
		  resulted in first-ever security patches and improved
		  security awareness.},
