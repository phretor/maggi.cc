  abstract	= {Radio frequency (RF) remote controllers are widely used in
		  manufacturing, construction, transportation, and many other
		  industrial applications. Cranes, drills, and miners, among
		  others, are commonly equipped with RF remotes.
		  Unfortunately, these devices have become the weakest link
		  in these safety-critical applications, characterized by
		  long life spans, high replacement costs, and cumbersome
		  patching processes. Given the pervasive connectivity
		  promoted by the Industry 4.0 trend, we foresee a security
		  risk in this domain as has happened in other fields.
		  
		  Our research reveals that RF remote controllers are
		  distributed globally, and millions of vulnerable units are
		  installed on heavy industrial machinery and environments.
		  Our extensive in-lab and on-site analysis of devices made
		  by seven popular vendors reveals a lack of security
		  features at different levels, with obscure, proprietary
		  protocols instead of standard ones. They are vulnerable to
		  command spoofing, so an attacker can selectively alter
		  their behavior by crafting arbitrary commands â€” with
		  consequences ranging from theft and extortion to sabotage
		  and injury.
		  
		  This research analyzes and shows how an attacker can
		  persistently and remotely take control or simulate the
		  malfunction of the attached machinery, through attacks like
		  command injection, emergency-stop (e-stop) abuse, and
		  malicious re-pairing. In addition, many modern radio
		  controllers can be programmed via software, which also
		  lacks any security measures, opening them to remote attack
		  vectors. A remote attacker who compromises the computer
		  used to program these remotes can alter their firmware to
		  implement persistent and sophisticated attacks.
		  
		  Having examined the root cause of the vulnerabilities that
		  make these attacks possible, we have reached out to the
		  affected vendors to promote suitable mitigation, and we
		  hope that our research will help raise awareness and avoid
		  unfortunate situations regarding RF remote controllers in
		  industrial applications.},
