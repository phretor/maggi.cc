  abstract	= {In an effort to hinder attackers from compromising user
		  accounts, Facebook launched a form of two-factor
		  authentication called social authentication (SA), where
		  users are required to identify photos of their friends to
		  complete a log-in attempt. Recent research, however,
		  demonstrated that attackers can bypass the mechanism by
		  employing face recognition software. Here we demonstrate an
		  alternative attack. that employs image comparison
		  techniques to identify the SA photos within an offline
		  collection of the users' photos. In this paper, we revisit
		  the concept of SA and design a system with a novel photo
		  selection and transformation process, which generates
		  challenges that are robust against these attacks. The
		  intuition behind our photo selection is to use photos. that
		  fail software-based face recognition, while remaining
		  recognizable to humans who are familiar with the depicted
		  people. The photo transformation process. creates
		  challenges in the form of photo collages, where faces are
		  transformed so as to render image matching techniques
		  ineffective. We experimentally confirm the robustness of
		  our approach against three template. matching algorithms
		  that solve 0.4 percent of the challenges, while requiring
		  four orders of magnitude more processing effort.
		  Furthermore, when the transformations are applied, face
		  detection software fails to detect even a single face. Our
		  user studies confirm that users are able to identify their
		  friends in over 99% of the photos with faces unrecognizable
		  by software, and can solve over 94 percent of the
		  challenges with transformed photos.},
