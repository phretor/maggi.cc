  abstract	= {The significant growth of online banking frauds, fueled by
		  the underground economy of malware, raised the need for
		  effective fraud analysis systems. Unfortunately, almost all
		  of the existing approaches adopt black box models and
		  mechanisms that do not give any justifications to analysts.
		  Also, the development of such methods is stifled by limited
		  Internet banking data availability for the scientific
		  community. In this paper we describe BankSealer, a decision
		  support system for online banking fraud analysis and
		  investigation. During a training phase, BankSealer builds
		  easy-to-understand models for each customer's spending
		  habits, based on past transactions. First, it quantifies
		  the anomaly of each transaction with respect to the
		  customer historical profile. Second, it finds global
		  clusters of customers with similar spending habits. Third,
		  it uses a temporal threshold system that measures the
		  anomaly of the current spending pattern of each customer,
		  with respect to his or her past spending behavior. With
		  this threefold profiling approach, it mitigates the
		  under-training due to the lack of historical data for
		  building well-trained profiles, and the evolution of users'
		  spending habits over time. At runtime, BankSealer supports
		  analysts by ranking new transactions that deviate from the
		  learned profiles, with an output that has an easily
		  understandable, immediate statistical meaning.
		  
		  Our evaluation on real data, based on fraud scenarios built
		  in collaboration with domain experts that replicate
		  typical, real-world attacks (e.g., credential stealing,
		  banking trojan activity, and frauds repeated over time),
		  shows that our approach correctly ranks complex frauds. In
		  particular, we measure the effectiveness, the computational
		  resource requirements and the capabilities of BankSealer to
		  mitigate the problem of users that performed a low number
		  of transactions. Our system ranks frauds and anomalies with
		  up to 98% detection rate and with a maximum daily
		  computation time of 4~min. Given the good results, a
		  leading Italian bank deployed a version of BankSealer in
		  their environment to analyze frauds.},
