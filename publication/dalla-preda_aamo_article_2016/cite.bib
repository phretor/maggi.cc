  abstract	= {The authors of mobile-malware have started to leverage
		  program protection techniques to circumvent anti-viruses,
		  or simply hinder reverse engineering. In response to the
		  diffusion of anti-virus applications, several researches
		  have proposed a plethora of analyses and approaches to
		  highlight their limitations when malware authors employ
		  program-protection techniques. An important contribution of
		  this work is a systematization of the state of the art of
		  anti-virus apps, comparing the existing approaches and
		  providing a detailed analysis of their pros and cons. As a
		  result of our systematization, we notice the lack of
		  openness and reproducibility that, in our opinion, are
		  crucial for any analysis methodology. Following this
		  observation, the second contribution of this work is an
		  open, reproducible, rigorous methodology to assess the
		  effectiveness of mobile anti-virus tools against
		  code-transformation attacks. Our unified workflow, released
		  in the form of an open-source prototype, comprises a
		  comprehensive set of obfuscation operators. It is intended
		  to be used by anti-virus developers and vendors to test the
		  resilience of their products against a large dataset of
		  malware samples and obfuscations, and to obtain insights on
		  how to improve their products with respect to particular
		  classes of code-transformation attacks.},
