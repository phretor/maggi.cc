  abstract	= {Anomaly-based techniques were exploited successfully to
		  implement protection mechanisms for various systems.
		  Recently, these approaches have been ported to the web
		  domain under the name of ``web application anomaly
		  detectors'' (or firewalls) with promising results. In
		  particular, those capable of automatically building
		  specifications, or models, of the protected application by
		  observing its traffic (e.g., network packets, system calls,
		  or HTTP requests and responses) are particularly
		  interesting, since they can be deployed with little effort.
		  Typically, the detection accuracy of these systems is
		  significantly influenced by the model building phase (often
		  called training), which clearly depends upon the quality of
		  the observed traffic, which should resemble the normal
		  activity of the protected application and must be also free
		  from attacks. Otherwise, detection may result in
		  significant amounts of false positives (i.e., benign events
		  flagged as anomalous) and negatives (i.e., undetected
		  threats). In this work we describe Masibty, a web
		  application anomaly detector that have some interesting
		  properties. First, it requires the training data not to be
		  attack-free. Secondly, not only it protects the monitored
		  application, it also detects and blocks malicious
		  client-side threats before they are sent to the browser.
		  Third, Masibty intercepts the queries before they are sent
		  to the database, correlates them with the corresponding
		  HTTP requests and blocks those deemed anomalous. Both the
		  accuracy and the performance have been evaluated on
		  real-world web applications with interesting results. The
		  system is almost not influenced by the presence of attacks
		  in the training data and shows only a negligible amount of
		  false positives, although this is paid in terms of a slight
		  performance overhead.},
