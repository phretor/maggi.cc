  abstract	= {In this paper we analyze the use of different types of
		  statistical tests for the correlation of anomaly detection
		  alerts. We show that the Granger Causality Test, one of the
		  few proposals that can be extended to the anomaly detection
		  domain, strongly depends on good choices of a parameter
		  which proves to be both sensitive and difficult to
		  estimate. We propose a different approach based on a set of
		  simpler statistical tests, and we prove that our criteria
		  work well on a simplified correlation task, without
		  requiring complex configuration parameters.},
