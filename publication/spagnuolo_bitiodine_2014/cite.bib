  abstract	= {Bitcoin, the famous peer-to-peer, decentralized electronic
		  currency system, allows users to benefit from pseudonymity,
		  by generating an arbitrary number of aliases (or addresses)
		  to move funds. However, the complete history of all
		  transactions ever performed, called "blockchain", is public
		  and replicated on each node. The data it contains is
		  difficult to analyze manually, but can yield a high number
		  of relevant information.
		  
		  In this paper we present a modular framework, BitIodine,
		  which parses the blockchain, clusters addresses that are
		  likely to belong to a same user or group of users,
		  classifies such users and labels them, and finally
		  visualizes complex information extracted from the Bitcoin
		  network.
		  
		  BitIodine labels users (semi-)automatically with
		  information on their identity and actions which is
		  automatically scraped from openly available information
		  sources. BitIodine also supports manual investigation by
		  finding paths and reverse paths between addresses or users.
		  
		  We tested BitIodine on several real-world use cases,
		  identified an address likely to belong to the encrypted
		  Silk Road cold wallet, or investigated the CryptoLocker
		  ransomware and accurately quantified the number of ransoms
		  paid, as well as information about the victims.
		  
		  We release an early prototype of BitIodine as a library for
		  building more complex Bitcoin forensic analysis tools.},
