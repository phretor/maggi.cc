  abstract	= {Probabilistic record linkage regards the use of stochastic
		  decision models to solve the problem of record linkage
		  (also known as record matching). Data quality has became a
		  key aspect in many institutions and the demand for novel,
		  effective techniques is increasing. Record linkage in
		  general has been studied in the last three decades and a
		  solid probabilistic decision framework has been proposed
		  along with several extensions and specific estimation
		  methods. This paper is a survey work narrowed to the most
		  recent and promising approaches also including a selection
		  of data cleansing tools based on probabilistic decision
		  models.},
