  abstract	= {Modern vehicles incorporate tens of electronic control
		  units (ECUs), driven by as much as 100,000,000 lines of
		  code. They are tightly interconnected via internal
		  networks, mostly based on the CAN bus standard. Past
		  research showed that, by obtaining physical access to the
		  network or by remotely compromising a vulnerable ECU, an
		  attacker could control even safety-critical inputs such as
		  throttle, steering or brakes. In order to secure current
		  CAN networks from cyberattacks, detection and prevention
		  approaches based on the analysis of transmitted frames have
		  been proposed, and are generally considered the most time-
		  and cost-effective solution, to the point that companies
		  have started promoting aftermarket products for existing
		  vehicles.},
