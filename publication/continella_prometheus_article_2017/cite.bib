  abstract	= {Nowadays Information stealers are reaching high levels of
		  sophistication. The number of families and variants
		  observed increased exponentially in the last years.
		  Furthermore, these trojans are sold on underground markets
		  along with automatic frameworks that include web-based
		  administration panels, builders and customization
		  procedures. From a technical point of view such malware is
		  equipped with a functionality, called WebInject, that
		  exploits API hooking techniques to intercept all sensitive
		  data in a browser context and modify web pages on infected
		  hosts. In this paper we propose Prometheus, an automatic
		  system that is able to analyze trojans that base their
		  attack technique on DOM modifications. Prometheus is able
		  to identify the injection operations performed by malware,
		  and generate signatures based on the injection behavior.
		  Furthermore, it is able to extract the WebInject targets by
		  using memory forensic techniques. We evaluated Prometheus
		  against real-world, online websites and a dataset of
		  distinct variants of financial trojans. In our experiments
		  we show that our approach correctly recognizes known
		  variants of WebInject-based malware and successfully
		  extracts the WebInject targets. },
