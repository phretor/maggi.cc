  abstract	= {Different critical infrastructures have been hit with
		  attacks such as those that involved the infamous Stuxnet
		  malware1 and the more recent Triton malware.2 These
		  incidents — attacks on manufacturing and other sectors
		  that use industrial control systems (ICSs) — continue to
		  be heard of through the years. In 2017, for instance, the
		  notorious WannaCry ransomware shut down a car manufacturing
		  factory in Japan,3 and another ransomware attack took down
		  a factory in North Carolina, U.S.4Smart factories attract
		  the interest of threat actors for the critical and
		  sensitive infrastructures they usually handle. A successful
		  attack, no matter how difficult the execution, can yield
		  high-impact results that can corner an organization into
		  giving in to cybercriminals’ demands or, at the very
		  least, cost it considerable losses.Prompted by our desire
		  to determine how knowledgeable and imaginative attackers
		  could be in compromising a manufacturing facility, we built
		  the most realistic factory honeypot we had ever created.
		  And in doing so, we also created an ideal environment where
		  we could monitor and learn about the attacks that the
		  honeypot came to attract. From conceptualization to actual
		  execution, our factory honeypot was designed to be an
		  attractive target for potential cybercriminals.Our factory
		  honeypot took on the ruse of a small fictitious company
		  that apparently handled clients from critical industries
		  yet possessed inadequate security defenses. Our ruse proved
		  successful as our honeypot saw several attacks, which we
		  had the freedom and resources to monitor. These attacks
		  included a malicious cryptocurrency mining campaign, two
		  ransomware attacks, another that posed as a ransomware
		  attack, and several scanners.In this research paper, we
		  detail the conceptualization and creation of our most
		  elaborate honeypot to date, and discuss the result of our
		  monitoring and tracking of the incidents that occurred on
		  the honeypot.},
