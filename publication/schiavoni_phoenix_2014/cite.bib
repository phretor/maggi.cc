  abstract	= {Modern botnets rely on domain-generation algorithms (DGAs)
		  to build resilient command-and-control infrastructures.
		  Given the prevalence of this mechanism, recent work has
		  focused on the analysis of DNS traffic to recognize botnets
		  based on their DGAs. While previous work has concentrated
		  on detection, we focus on supporting intelligence
		  operations. We propose Phoenix, a mechanism that, in
		  addition to telling DGA- and non-DGA-generated domains
		  apart using a combination of string and IP-based features,
		  characterizes the DGAs behind them, and, most importantly,
		  finds groups of DGA-generated domains that are
		  representative of the respective botnets. As a result,
		  Phoenix can associate previously unknown DGA-generated
		  domains to these groups, and produce novel knowledge about
		  the evolving behavior of each tracked botnet. We evaluated
		  Phoenix on 1,153,516 domains, including DGA-generated
		  domains from modern, well-known botnets: without
		  supervision, it correctly distinguished DGA- vs.
		  non-DGA-generated domains in 94.8 percent of the cases,
		  characterized families of domains that belonged to distinct
		  DGAs, and helped researchers ``on the field'' in gathering
		  intelligence on suspicious domains to identify the correct
		  botnet.},
