  abstract	= {Manual analysis of security-related events is still a
		  necessity to investigate non-trivial cyber attacks. This
		  task is particularly hard when the events involve slow,
		  stealthy and large-scale activities typical of the modern
		  cybercriminals' strategy. In this regard, visualization
		  tools can effectively help analysts in their
		  investigations. In this paper, we present BURN, an
		  interactive visualization tool for displaying autonomous
		  systems exhibiting rogue activity that helps at finding
		  misbehaving networks through visual and interactive
		  exploration. Up to seven values are displayed in a single
		  visual element, while avoiding cumbersome and confusing
		  maps. To this end, animations and alpha channels are
		  leveraged to create simple views that highlight relevant
		  activity patterns. In addition, BURN incorporates a simple
		  algorithm to identify migrations of nefarious services
		  across autonomous systems, which can support, for instance,
		  root-cause analysis and law enforcement investigations.},
