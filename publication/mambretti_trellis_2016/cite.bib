  abstract	= {Operating systems provide a wide variety of resource
		  isolation and access control mechanisms, ranging from
		  traditional user-based security models to fine-grained
		  permission systems as found in modern mobile operating
		  systems. However, comparatively little assistance is
		  available for defining and enforcing access control
		  policies within multiuser applications. These applications,
		  often found in enterprise environments, allow multiple
		  users to operate at different privilege levels in terms of
		  exercising application functionality and accessing data.
		  Developers of such applications bear a heavy burden in
		  ensuring that security policies over code and data in this
		  setting are properly expressed and enforced. We present
		  Trellis, an approach for expressing hierarchical access
		  control policies in applications and enforcing these
		  policies during execution. The approach enhances the
		  development toolchain to allow programmers to partially
		  annotate code and data with simple privilege level tags,
		  and uses a static analysis to infer suitable tags for the
		  entire application. At runtime, policies are extracted from
		  the resulting binaries and are enforced by a modified
		  operating system kernel. Our evaluation demonstrates that
		  this approach effectively supports the development of
		  secure multi-user applications with modest runtime
		  performance overhead.},
