  abstract	= {Nowadays users often possess a variety of electronic
		  devices for communication and entertainment. In particular,
		  smartphones are playing an increasingly central role in
		  users’ lives: Users carry them everywhere they go and
		  often use them to control other devices. This trend
		  provides incentives for the industry to tackle new
		  challenges, such as cross-device authentication, and to
		  develop new monetization schemes. A new technology based on
		  ultrasounds has recently emerged to meet these demands.
		  Ultrasound technology has a number of desirable features:
		  it is easy to deploy, flexible, and inaudible by humans.
		  This technology is already utilized in a number of
		  different real-world applications, such as device pairing,
		  proximity detection, and cross-device tracking.
		  
		  This paper examines the different facets of
		  ultrasound-based technology. Initially, we discuss how it
		  is already used in the real world, and subsequently examine
		  this emerging technology from the privacy and security
		  perspectives. In particular, we first observe that the lack
		  of OS features results in violations of the principle of
		  least privilege: an app that wants to use this technology
		  currently needs to require full access to the device
		  microphone. We then analyse real-world Android apps and
		  find that tracking techniques based on ultrasounds suffer
		  from a number of vulnerabilities and are susceptible to
		  various attacks. For example, we show that ultrasound
		  cross-device tracking deployments can be abused to perform
		  stealthy deanonymization attacks (e.g., to unmask users who
		  browse the Internet through anonymity networks such as
		  Tor), to inject fake or spoofed audio beacons, and to leak
		  a user’s private information.
		  
		  Based on our findings, we introduce several defense
		  mechanisms. We first propose and implement immediately
		  deployable defenses that empower practitioners,
		  researchers, and everyday users to protect their privacy.
		  In particular, we introduce a browser extension and an
		  Android permission that enable the user to selectively
		  suppress frequencies falling within the ultrasonic
		  spectrum. We then argue for the standardization of
		  ultrasound beacons, and we envision a flexible OS-level API
		  that addresses both the effortless deployment of
		  ultrasound-enabled applications, and the prevention of
		  existing privacy and security problems.},
