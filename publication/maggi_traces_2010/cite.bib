  abstract	= {A one-pass recognition algorithm is presented to solve the
		  membership problem for rational trace languages. The
		  algorithm is detailed through the formal specification of
		  the Buffer Machine, a non-deterministic, finite-state
		  automaton with multiple buffers that can solve the
		  membership problem in polynomial time. The performances and
		  characteristics of the proposed solution are evaluated on a
		  testbed implementation using pseudo-random traces, strings,
		  languages and dependency relations.},
