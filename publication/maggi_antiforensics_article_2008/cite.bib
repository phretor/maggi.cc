  abstract	= {Anti-forensics is the practice of circumventing classical
		  forensics analysis procedures making them either unreliable
		  or impossible. In this paper we propose the use of machine
		  learning algorithms and anomaly detection to cope with a
		  wide class of definitive anti-forensics techniques. We test
		  the proposed system on a dataset we created through the
		  implementation of an innovative technique of
		  anti-forensics, and we show that our approach yields
		  promising results in terms of detection.},
