  abstract	= {Compared to traditional desktop software, Android
		  applications are delivered through software repositories,
		  commonly known as application markets. Other mobile
		  platforms, such as Apple iOS and BlackBerry OS also use the
		  marketplace model, but what is unique to Android is the
		  existence of a plethora of alternative application markets.
		  This complicates the task of detecting and tracking Android
		  malware. Identifying a malicious application in one
		  particular market is simply not enough, as many instances
		  of this application may exist in other markets. To quantify
		  this phenomenon, we exhaustively crawled 8 markets between
		  June and November 2013. Our findings indicate that
		  alternative markets host a large number of ad-aggressive
		  apps, a non-negligible amount of malware, and some markets
		  even allow authors to publish known malicious apps without
		  prompt action. Motivated by these findings, we present
		  AndRadar, a framework for discovering multiple instances of
		  a malicious Android application in a set of alternative
		  application markets. AndRadar scans a set of markets in
		  parallel to discover similar applications. Each lookup
		  takes no more than a few seconds, regardless of the size of
		  the marketplace. Moreover, it is modular, and new markets
		  can be transparently added once the search and download
		  URLs are known. Using AndRadar we are able to achieve three
		  goals. First, we can discover malicious applications in
		  alternative markets, second, we can expose app distribution
		  strategies used by malware developers, and third, we can
		  monitor how different markets react to new malware. During
		  a three-month evaluation period, AndRadar tracked over
		  20,000 apps and recorded more than 1,500 app deletions in
		  16 markets. Nearly 8% of those deletions were related to
		  apps that were hopping from market to market. The most
		  established markets were able to react and delete new
		  malware within tens of days from the malicious app
		  publication date while other markets did not react at
		  all.},
