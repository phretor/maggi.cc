  abstract	= {The capabilities of modern devices, coupled with the
		  almost ubiquitous availability of Internet connectivity,
		  have resulted in photos being shared online at an
		  unprecedented scale. This is further amplified by the
		  popularity of social networks and the immediacy they offer
		  in content sharing. Existing access control mechanisms are
		  too coarse-grained to handle cases of conflicting interests
		  between the users associated with a photo; stories of
		  embarrassing or inappropriate photos being widely
		  accessible have become quite common. In this paper, we
		  propose to rethink access control when applied to photos,
		  in a way that allows us to effectively prevent unwanted
		  individuals from recognizing users in a photo. The core
		  concept behind our approach is to change the granularity of
		  access control from the level of the photo to that of a
		  user's personally identifiable information (PII). In this
		  work, we consider the face as the PII. When another user
		  attempts to access a photo, the system determines which
		  faces the user does not have the permission to view, and
		  presents the photo with the restricted faces blurred out.
		  Our system takes advantage of the existing face recognition
		  functionality of social networks, and can interoperate with
		  the current photo-level access control mechanisms. We
		  implement a proof-of-concept application for Facebook, and
		  demonstrate that the performance overhead of our approach
		  is minimal. We also conduct a user study to evaluate the
		  privacy offered by our approach, and find that it
		  effectively prevents users from identifying their contacts
		  in 87.35% of the restricted photos. Finally, our study
		  reveals the misconceptions about the privacy offered by
		  existing mechanisms, and demonstrates that users are
		  positive towards the adoption of an intuitive,
		  straightforward access control mechanism that allows them
		  to manage the visibility of their face in published
		  photos.},
