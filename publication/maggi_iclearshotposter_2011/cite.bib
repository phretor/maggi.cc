  abstract	= {Touchscreen devices increase the risk of shoulder surfing
		  to such an extent that attackers could steal sensitive
		  information by simply following the victim and observe his
		  or her portable device. We underline this concern by
		  proposing an automatic shoulder surfing attack against
		  modern touchscreen keyboards that display magnified keys in
		  predictable positions. We demonstrate this attack against
		  the Apple iPhone although it can work with other layouts
		  and different devices and show that it recognizes up to
		  97.07% (91.03% on average) of the keystrokes, with only
		  1.15% of errors, at 37 to 51 keystrokes per minute: About
		  eight times faster than a human analyzing a recorded video.
		  Our attack accurately recovers the sequence of keystrokes
		  input by the user. A previous attack, which targeted
		  desktop scenarios and thus worked with very restrictive
		  settings, is similar in spirit to ours. However, as it
		  assumes that camera and target keyboard are both in fixed,
		  perpendicular position, it cannot suite mobile settings,
		  characterized by moving target and skewed, rotated
		  viewpoints. Our attack, instead, requires no particular
		  settings and even allows for natural movements of both
		  target device and shoulder surfer's camera. In addition,
		  our attack yields accurate output without any grammar or
		  syntax checks, so that it can detect large context-free
		  text or non-dictionary words.},
