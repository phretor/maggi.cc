  abstract	= {This research is a joint effort between Politecnico di
		  Milano, Linklayer Labs, and Trend Micro's FTR. In this
		  report, we describe a vulnerability in modern cars’
		  networks that allows a completely stealthy
		  denial-of-service attack which is undetectable by current
		  security mechanisms and works for every automotive vendor.
		  This attack differs drastically from other previously
		  reported car hacks because it does not exploit easily
		  patchable software vulnerabilities. Rather, the element
		  exploited is a design flaw, which is thus fundamentally
		  hard to solve, in the standard that defines how in-vehicle
		  networks work.
		  
		  This attack was presented at the 2017 international
		  conference on Detection of Intrusions and Malware &
		  Vulnerability Assessment (DIMVA) in Bonn (Jul 6–7). Prior
		  to that, we coordinated with the ICS-CERT, which promptly
		  disseminated an alert (ICS-ALERT-17-209-01).},
