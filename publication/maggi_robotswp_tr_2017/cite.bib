		  industrial robots are by now widely known, but to date,
		  there has been no in-depth, hands-on research that
		  demonstrates to what extent robots can actually be
		  compromised. For the first time, with this research—a
		  collaboration between Politecnico di Milano (POLIMI) and
		  the Trend Micro Forward-Looking Threat Research (FTR)
		  Team—we have been able to analyze the impact of
		  system-specific attacks and demonstrate attack scenarios on
		  actual standard industrial robots in a controlled
		  environment. In industrial devices, the impact of a single,
		  simple software vulnerability can already have serious
		  consequences. Depending on the actual setup and security
		  posture of the targeted smart factory, attackers could
		  trigger attacks that could amount to massive financial
		  damage to the company in question or at worst, even affect
		  critical goods. Almost all industry sectors that are
		  critical for a nation are potentially at risk.
		  
		  Unfortunately, the Industry 4.0 revolution is just bringing
		  industrial robots closer to the forefront. As improvements
		  in the way industrial robots work and communicate increase
		  their complexity and interconnectedness, the industrial
		  robots sector unlocks a broader attack surface. In our
		  security analysis, we found that the software running on
		  these devices is outdated; based on vulnerable OSs and
		  libraries, sometimes relying on obsolete or cryptographic
		  libraries; and have weak authentication systems with
		  default, unchangeable credentials. Additionally, the Trend
		  Micro FTR Team found tens of thousands of industrial
		  devices residing on public IP addresses, which could
		  include exposed industrial robots, further increasing the
		  risk that an attacker can access and hack them.
		  
		  The impact of vulnerabilities, for example on robots, is
		  what makes our findings a very loud wake-up call for the
		  industrial control systems (ICS) sector. To quantify such
		  impact, our security analysis revealed that industrial
		  robots must follow three fundamental laws—accurately
		  “read” from the physical world through sensors and
		  “write” (i.e., perform actions) through motors and
		  tools, refuse to execute self-damaging control logic, and
		  most importantly, echo one of the “Laws of Robotics”
		  (devised by Isaac Asimov, a popular science writer) to
		  never harm humans. Then, by combining the set of
		  vulnerabilities that we discovered on a real, standard
		  robot installed in our laboratory, we demonstrated how
		  remote attackers can violate such fundamental laws up to
		  the point where they can alter or introduce minor defects
		  in the manufactured product, physically damage the robot,
		  steal industry secrets, or injure humans. We then
		  considered some threat scenarios on how attackers
		  capitalized on these attacks, as in an act of sabotage or a
		  ransomware-like scheme.
		  
		  On the one hand, industrial devices are designed according
		  to strict physical security and safety standards in order
		  to work in rough conditions with extreme temperature
		  ranges, vibrations, and electromagnetic noise. On the
		  other, because of the ubiquity and flexibility demanded by
		  the Industry 4.0 trend, industrial devices are being
		  designed to be flexible, easy to deploy, and to not
		  necessarily require any special security or IT skills.
		  These opposing design requirements make producers very
		  prone to introducing software bugs.
		  
		  Rather than concluding this paper with a classic checklist
		  for ICS vendors, we reflected on reasons why the situation
		  has not changed much over the years. Thus, we provided a
		  series of research and engineering challenges that we
		  believe will make a difference in the journey to secure the
		  Industry 4.0 ecosystem. On this journey toward improving
		  the security posture of robots in the Industry 4.0 setting,
		  we also began reaching out to vendors, among whom ABB
		  Robotics stood out in that it readily welcomed suggestions
		  we had to offer and even started working on a response plan
		  that will affect its current product line without losing
		  time.},
