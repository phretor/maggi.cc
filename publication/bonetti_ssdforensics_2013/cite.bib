  abstract	= {Solid-state drives (SSDs) are inherently different from
		  traditional drives, as they incorporate data-optimization
		  mechanisms to overcome their limitations (such as a limited
		  number of program-erase cycles, or the need of blanking a
		  block before writing). The most common optimizations are
		  wear leveling, trimming, compression, and garbage
		  collection, which operate transparently to the host OS and,
		  in certain cases, even when the disks are disconnected from
		  a computer (but still powered up). In simple words, SSD
		  controllers are designed to hide these internals
		  completely, rendering them inaccessible if not through
		  direct acquisition of the memory cells. These optimizations
		  have a significant impact on the forensic analysis of SSDs.
		  The main cause is that memory cells could be pre-emptively
		  blanked, whereas a traditional drive sector would need to
		  be explicitly rewritten to physically wipe off the data.
		  Unfortunately, the existing literature on this subject is
		  sparse and the conclusions are seemingly contradictory. In
		  this paper we propose a generic, practical, test-driven
		  methodology that guides researchers and forensics analysts
		  through a series of steps that assess the "forensic
		  friendliness" of a SSD. Given a drive of the same brand and
		  model of the one under analysis, our methodology produces a
		  decision that helps an analyst to determine whether or not
		  an expensive direct acquisition of the memory cells is
		  worth the effort, because the extreme optimizations may
		  have rendered the data unreadable or useless. We apply our
		  methodology to three SSDs produced by top vendors (Samsung,
		  Corsair, and Crucial), and provide a detailed description
		  of how each step should be conducted.},
