  abstract	= {Although there are controversial opinions regarding how
		  large the mobile malware phenomenon is in terms of absolute
		  numbers, hype aside, the amount of new Android malware
		  variants is increasing. This trend is mainly due to the
		  fact that, as it happened with traditional malware, the
		  authors are striving to repackage, obfuscate, or otherwise
		  transform the executable code of their malicious apps in
		  order to evade mobile security apps. There are about 85 of
		  these apps only on the official marketplace. However, it is
		  not clear how effective they are. Indeed, the sandboxing
		  mechanism of Android does not allow (security) apps to
		  audit other apps. We present AndroTotal, a publicly
		  available tool, malware repository and research framework
		  that aims at mitigating the above challenges, and allow
		  researchers to automatically scan Android apps against an
		  arbitrary set of malware detectors. We implemented
		  AndroTotal and released it to the research community in
		  April 2013. So far, we collected 18,758 distinct submitted
		  samples and received the attention of several research
		  groups (1,000 distinct accounts), who integrated their
		  malware-analysis services with ours.},
