  abstract	= {Smart manufacturing systems are an attractive target for
		  cyber attacks, because they embed valuable data andcritical
		  equipment. Despite the market is driving towards integrated
		  and interconnected factories, current smartmanufacturing
		  systems are still designed under the assumption that they
		  will stay isolated from the corporatenetwork and the
		  outside world. This choice may result in an internal
		  architecture with insufficient network andsystem
		  compartmentalization. As a result, once an attacker has
		  gained access, they have full control of the
		  entireproduction plant because of the lack of network
		  segmentation.With the goal of raising cybersecurity
		  awareness, in this paper we describe a practical case study
		  showing attackscenarios that we have validated on a real
		  modular smart manufacturing system, and suggest practical
		  securitycountermeasures. The testbed smart manufacturing
		  system is part of the Industry 4.0 research laboratory
		  hosted byPolitecnico di Milano, and comprises seven
		  assembly stations, each with their programmable logic
		  controllers andhuman-computer interfaces, as well as an
		  industrial robotic arm that performs pick-and-place
		  tasks.On this testbed we show two indirect attacks to gain
		  initial access, even under the best-case scenario of a
		  system notdirectly connected to any public network. We
		  conclude by showing two post-exploitation scenarios that an
		  adversarycan use to cause physical impact on the
		  production, or keep persistent access to the plant.We are
		  unaware of a similar security analysis performed within the
		  premises of a research facility, following ascientific
		  methodology, so we believe that this work can represent a
		  good first step to inspire follow up research onthe many
		  verticals that we touch.},
