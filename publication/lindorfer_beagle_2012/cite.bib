  abstract	= {Malicious software installed on infected computers is a
		  fundamental component of online crime. Malware development
		  thus plays an essential role in the underground economy of
		  cyber-crime. Malware authors regularly update their
		  software to defeat defenses or to support new or improved
		  criminal business models. A large body of research has
		  focused on detecting malware, defending against it and
		  identifying its functionality. In addition to these goals,
		  however, the analysis of malware can provide a glimpse into
		  the software development industry that develops malicious
		  code. In this work, we present techniques to observe the
		  evolution of a malware family over time. First, we develop
		  techniques to compare versions of malicious code and
		  quantify their differences. Furthermore, we use behavior
		  observed from dynamic analysis to assign semantics to
		  binary code and to identify functional components within a
		  malware binary. By combining these techniques, we are able
		  to monitor the evolution of a malware's functional
		  components. We implement these techniques in a system we
		  call BEAGLE, and apply it to the observation of 16 malware
		  strains over several months. The results of these
		  experiments provide insight into the effort involved in
		  updating malware code, and show that BEAGLE can identify
		  changes to individual malware components.},
