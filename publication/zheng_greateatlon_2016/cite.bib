  abstract	= {Ransomware is a class of malware that aim at preventing
		  victims from accessing valuable data, typically via data
		  encryption or device locking, and ask for a payment to
		  release the target. In the past year, instances of
		  ransomware attacks have been spotted on mobile devices too.
		  However, despite their relatively low infection rate, we
		  notice that the techniques used by mobile ransomware are
		  quite sophisticated, and different from those used by
		  ransomware against traditional computers.
		  
		  Through an in-depth analysis of about 100 samples of
		  currently active ransomware apps, we conclude that most of
		  them pass undetected by state-of-the-art tools, which are
		  unable to recognize the abuse of benign features for
		  malicious purposes. The main reason is that such tools rely
		  on an inadequate and incomplete set of features. The most
		  notable examples are the abuse of reflection and
		  device-administration APIs, appearing in modern ransomware
		  to evade analysis and detection, and to elevate their
		  privileges (e.g., to lock or wipe the device). Moreover,
		  current solutions introduce several false positives in the
		  na ̈ıve way they detect cryptographic-APIs abuse,
		  flagging goodware apps as ransomware merely because they
		  rely on cryptographic libraries. Last but not least, the
		  performance overhead of current approaches is unacceptable
		  for appstore-scale workloads.
		  
		  In this work, we tackle the aforementioned limitations and
		  propose GreatEatlon, a next-generation mobile ransomware
		  detector. We foresee GreatEatlon deployed on the appstore
		  side, as a preventive countermeasure. At its core,
		  GreatEatlon uses static program-analysis techniques to
		  ``resolve'' reflection-based, anti-analysis attempts, to
		  recognize abuses of the device administration API, and
		  extract accurate data-flow information required to detect
		  truly malicious uses of cryptographic APIs. Given the
		  significant resources utilized by Great- Eatlon, we prepend
		  to its core a fast pre-filter that quickly discards obvious
		  goodware, in order to avoid wasting computer cycles.
		  
		  We tested GreatEatlon on thousands of samples of goodware,
		  generic malware and ransomware applications, and showed
		  that it surpasses current approaches both in speed and
		  detection capabilities, while keeping the false negative
		  rate below 1.3%. },
