  abstract	= {Malware analysts, and in particular antivirus vendors,
		  never agreed on a single naming convention for malware
		  specimens. This leads to confusion and difficulty more for
		  researchers than for practitioners for example, when
		  comparing coverage of different antivirus engines, when
		  integrating and systematizing known threats, or comparing
		  the classifications given by different detectors. Clearly,
		  solving naming inconsistencies is a very difficult task, as
		  it requires that vendors agree on a unified naming
		  convention. More importantly, solving inconsistencies is
		  impossible without knowing exactly where they are.
		  Therefore, in this paper we take a step back and
		  concentrate on the problem of finding inconsistencies. To
		  this end, we first represent each vendor's naming
		  convention with a graph-based model. Second, we give a
		  precise definition of inconsistency with respect to these
		  models. Third, we define two quantitative measures to
		  calculate the overall degree of inconsistency between
		  vendors. In addition, we propose a fast algorithm that
		  finds non-trivial (i.e., beyond syntactic differences)
		  inconsistencies. Our experiments on four major antivirus
		  vendors and 98,798 real-world malware samples confirm
		  anecdotal observations that different vendors name viruses
		  differently. More importantly, we were able to find
		  inconsistencies that cannot be inferred at all by looking
		  solely at the syntax.},
