  abstract	= {An improved, one-pass version of a two-pass, Earley-like
		  recognition algorithm is here proposed to solve the
		  Membership Problem for rational trace languages in
		  polynomial time. The algorithm is first described through
		  the formal specification of what we called a Non
		  Deterministic Buffer Machine (NDBM); secondly, the
		  recognition is detailed through a deterministic algorithm
		  along with some running examples. In addition, we describe
		  our prototype implementation of the algorithm used to
		  empirically evaluate the performances and the
		  characteristics of the proposed solution. To this end, we
		  designed pseudo-random testing data generators that are
		  here described as well.},
