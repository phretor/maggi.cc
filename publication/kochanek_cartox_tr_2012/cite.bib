  abstract	= {Modern vehicles, and in particular electric vehicles, are
		  increasingly being equipped with interconnected computer
		  systems, which collect information through vehicular
		  sources and remote, Internet-connected services.
		  Unfortunately, this creates a non-negligible attack
		  surface, which extends even more when vehicles are
		  integrated with smartphones to offer advanced services. In
		  fact, embedded systems on vehicles have been developed to
		  address safety, not security requirements. Furthermore,
		  vehicles have real-time constraints, and the typical
		  embedded architectures used on board significantly
		  complicate security designs. In this paper, we introduce a
		  communication framework that addresses these challenges and
		  we demonstrate how a smartphone can interact with a vehicle
		  in a secure and safe manner. To this end, we design a
		  security session layer that ensures end-to-end security
		  transparently. We conduct an experimental evaluation on a
		  real implementation of our security layer, which shows that
		  our solution is practical and easy to use, satisfies
		  performance constraints, and meets real-time requirements
		  by taking into account the limited capabilities of our
		  target architecture. More precisely, we implement our
		  approach for an electrically-powered two-wheeler
		  manufactured by Piaggio, and show how a smartphone can
		  interact via a wireless link with the battery-life
		  controller in a secure manner. Interestingly, our approach
		  is not limited to vehicles, but can be used in other
		  application domains where a smartphone needs to securely
		  interact with an embedded device.},
