  abstract	= {Our research concentrates on anomaly detection techniques,
		  which have both industrial applications such as network
		  monitoring and protection, as well as research applications
		  such as software behavioral analysis or malware
		  classification. During our doctoral research, we worked on
		  anomaly detection from three different perspective, as a
		  complex computer infrastructure has several weak spots that
		  must be protected. We first focused on the operating
		  system, central to any computer, to avoid malicious code to
		  subvert its normal activity. Secondly, we concentrated on
		  web applications, which are the main interface to modern
		  computing: Because of their immense popularity, they have
		  indeed become the most targeted entry point of intrusions.
		  Last, we developed novel techniques with the aim of
		  identifying related events (e.g., alerts reported by
		  intrusion detection systems) to build new and more compact
		  knowledge to detect malicious activity on large-scale
		  systems. During our research we enhanced existing anomaly
		  detection tools and also contributed with new ones. Such
		  tools have been tested over different datasets, both
		  synthetic data and real network traffic, and lead to
		  interesting results that were accepted for publication at
		  main security venues.},
