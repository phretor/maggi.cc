  abstract	= {Modern trojans are equipped with a functionality, called
		  WebInject, that can be used to silently modify a web page
		  on the infected end host. Given its flexibility,
		  WebInject-based malware is becoming a popular
		  information-stealing mechanism. In addition, the structured
		  and well-organized malware-as-a-service model makes revenue
		  out of customization kits, which in turns leads to high
		  volumes of binary variants. Analysis approaches based on
		  memory carving to extract the decrypted webinject.txt and
		  config.bin files at runtime make the strong assumption that
		  the malware will never change the way such files are
		  handled internally, and therefore are not future proof by
		  design. In addition, developers of sensitive web
		  applications (e.g., online banking) have no tools that they
		  can possibly use to even mitigate the effect of
		  WebInjects.},
