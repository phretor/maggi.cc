  abstract	= {Android introduced the dynamic code loading (DCL)
		  mechanism to allow for code reuse, to achieve
		  extensibility, to enable updating functionalities or to
		  boost application start- up performance. In spite of its
		  wide adoption by developers, implementing DCL in a secure
		  way is challenging, leading to serious vulnerabilities such
		  as remote code injection. Previous academic and community
		  attempts at solving this problem are unfortunately either
		  impractical or incomplete, or in some cases exhibit
		  vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose, design,
		  implement and test Grab 'n Run, a novel code verification
		  protocol and a series of supporting libraries, APIs, and
		  components, that address the problem by abstracting away
		  from the developer challenging implementation details. Grab
		  'n Run is designed to be practical: among its tools, it
		  provides a drop-in library, which requires no modifications
		  to the Android framework or the underlying Dalvik/ART
		  runtime, is very similar to the native API, and most code
		  can be automatically rewritten to use it. Grab 'n Run also
		  contains an application rewriting tool, which allows easy
		  porting of existing applications to use the secure API of
		  its library. We evaluate Grab 'n Run library with a user
		  study, obtaining impressive results in vulnerability
		  reduction, ease of use and speed of development. We also
		  show that the performance overhead introduced by our
		  library is negligible. The library is released as free
		  software.},
