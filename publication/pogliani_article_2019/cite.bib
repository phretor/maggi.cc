  abstract	= {In modern factories, ``controlled'' manufacturing systems,
		  such as industrial robots, CNC machines, or 3D printers,
		  are often connected in a control network, together with a
		  plethora of heterogeneous control devices. Despite the
		  obvious advantages in terms of production and ease of
		  maintenance, this trend raises non-trivial cybersecurity
		  concerns. Often, the devices employed are not designed for
		  an interconnected world, but cannot be promptly replaced:
		  In fact, they have essentially become legacy systems,
		  embodying design patterns where components and networks are
		  accounted as trusted elements. In this paper, we take a
		  holistic view of the security issues (and challenges) that
		  arise in designing and securely deploying controlled
		  manufacturing systems, using industrial robots as a case
		  study---indeed, robots are the most representative instance
		  of a complex automatically controlled industrial device.
		  Following up to our previous experimental analysis, we take
		  a broad look at the deployment of industrial robots in a
		  typical factory network and at the security challenges that
		  arise from the interaction between operators and machines;
		  then, we propose actionable points to secure industrial
		  cyber-physical systems, and we discuss the limitations of
		  the current standards in industrial robotics to account for
		  active attackers.},
