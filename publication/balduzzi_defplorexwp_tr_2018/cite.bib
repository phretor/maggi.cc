  abstract	= {Web attacks—attacks that compromise internet assets like
		  mail servers, cloud infrastructures, and websites—are
		  troubling phenomena. The research community has put
		  considerable effort into investigating these incidents but
		  has mostly focused on detecting attacks and not delving
		  into the reasons behind these attacks.
		  
		  Of course, the typical cybercriminal's goal is to profit.
		  They might compromise websites to push ransomware, or they
		  could try and steal data—recent breaches show that
		  information is an increasingly valuable commodity. But, as
		  this paper discusses, more emotional motivations, such as
		  patriotism, specific real-world events or simply
		  hacktivism, can also trigger compromises.
		  
		  Web defacement hacktivism is the practice of subverting a
		  website with the goal of promoting a specific agenda or
		  political ideology. Methods may vary, but when hacktivists
		  compromise a website, the usual tactic involves replacing
		  the original page with their version—a practice that is
		  called web defacement. Hacktivism is mainly linked to web
		  defacement, but a hacktivist (the attacker) can also be
		  involved in traffic redirection (from a legitimate site to
		  an attackerowned site), denial of service (a form of
		  service disruption), and malware distribution to support
		  their particular cause.
		  
		  Dedicated websites like Zone-H1 collect evidence of web
		  defacements and defacers can voluntarily advertise their
		  compromise by submitting a report. Elaborating on the
		  reasons behind web defacements at scale is not as easy as
		  it seems. While someone could theorize that geopolitical
		  events and conflicts influence cybercriminals’ attacks
		  against websites and their choice of victims, corroborating
		  this phenomenon requires large-scale analysis.
		  
		  Our examination of over 13 million web defacement reports
		  against websites spans over 18 years, covering multiple
		  continents. We designed an internal system that gathers,
		  analyzes, and clusters these millions of reports. As we
		  identify the major campaigns of these defacers, we can
		  provide further insights into how geopolitical events are
		  reflected in web defacements. We also look at how different
		  factors, such as the political beliefs and the defacers'
		  religious inclination, can trigger and affect these
		  attacks.
		  
		  Our first two sections provide high-level insights into our
		  dataset of defacements, as well as some defining facts
		  about the targets and tactics used by the defacers. Our
		  next section on Real World Impact breaks down seven top
		  campaigns that have affected Israel, France, India, Syria,
		  Kosovo, and countries surrounding the South China Sea. We
		  delve into specific conflicts in those areas and the
		  defacements that happened in the aftermath.
		  
		  The succeeding sections cover the hacking groups'
		  affiliations and how their collectives are organized—some
		  collectives are formed across continents, and some are a
		  loose collection of local hackers. Recruitment tools and
		  the methods used to distribute hacking techniques are also
		  discussed.
		  
		  The final sections discuss other activities that defacers
		  take part in, and how the current activities may evolve.
		  Recently, there have been incidents of hackers who have
		  gone from simple web defacement to activities supporting
		  cybercrime. There is a real possibility that defacers and
		  defacement groups will start to escalate their activities,
		  move away from ideological motivations, and turn into
		  cybercrime. },
