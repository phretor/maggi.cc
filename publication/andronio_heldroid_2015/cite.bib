  abstract	= {In ransomware attacks, the actual target is the human, as
		  opposed to the classic attacks that abuse the infected
		  devices (e.g., botnet renting, information stealing).
		  Mobile devices are by no means immune to ransomware
		  attacks. However, there is little research work on this
		  matter and only traditional protections are available. Even
		  state-of-the-art mobile malware detection approaches are
		  ineffective against ransomware apps because of the subtle
		  attack scheme. As a consequence, the ample attack surface
		  formed by the billion mobile devices is left unprotected.
		  First, in this work we summarize the results of our
		  analysis of the existing mobile ransomware families,
		  describing their common characteristics. Second, we present
		  HelDroid, a fast, efficient and fully automated approach
		  that recognizes known and unknown scareware and ransomware
		  samples from goodware. Our approach is based on detecting
		  the ``build- ing blocks'' that are typically needed to
		  implement a mobile ransomware application. Specifically,
		  HelDroid detects, in a generic way, if an app is attempting
		  to lock or encrypt the device without the user’s consent,
		  and if ransom requests are displayed on the screen. Our
		  technique works without requiring that a sample of a
		  certain family is available beforehand. We implemented
		  HelDroid and tested it on real-world Android ransomware
		  samples. On a large dataset comprising hundreds of
		  thousands of APKs including goodware, malware, scareware,
		  and ransomware, HelDroid exhibited nearly zero false
		  positives and the capability of recognizing unknown
		  ransomware samples. },
