  abstract	= {The Web is replete with tutorial-style content on how to
		  accomplish programming tasks. Unfortunately, even
		  top-ranked tutorials suffer from severe security
		  vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), and
		  SQL injection (SQLi). Assuming that these tutorials
		  influence real-world software development, we hypothesize
		  that code snippets from popular tutorials can be used to
		  bootstrap vulnerability discovery at scale. To validate our
		  hypothesis, we propose a semi-automated approach to find
		  recurring vulnerabilities starting from a handful of
		  top-ranked tutorials that contain vulnerable code snippets.
		  We evaluate our approach by performing an analysis of tens
		  of thousands of open-source web applications to check if
		  vulnerabilities originating in the selected tutorials
		  recur. Our analysis framework has been running on a
		  standard PC, analyzed 64,415 PHP codebases hosted on GitHub
		  thus far, and found a total of 117 vulnerabilities that
		  have a strong syntactic similarity to vulnerable code
		  snippets present in popular tutorials. In addition to
		  shedding light on the anecdotal belief that programmers
		  reuse web tutorial code in an ad hoc manner, our study
		  finds disconcerting evidence of insufficiently reviewed
		  tutorials compromising the security of open-source
		  projects. Moreover, our findings testify to the feasibility
		  of large-scale vulnerability discovery using poorly written
		  tutorials as a starting point.},
