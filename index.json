DDS enables crucial technologies like autonomous driving, healthcare machinery, military tactical systems, or missile launch stations. Notably, DDS is used by NASA at the KSC, by SIEMENS for smart grid applications, by Volkswagen and Bosch for autonomous valet parking systems, by NAV CANADA for ATC, and by the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) to control industrial and consumer robots.  Designed around industrial-level requirements, DDS sits deep in the control network, allowing an arbitrary number of endpoints like sensors or actuators to communicate transparently, with an abstract API based on familiar data type specifications (e.g., C structs) and simple function calls, regardless of the complexity of the data.  We approached DDS from the bottom up, and we will show you how we wrote a Scapy layer to guide you through the packet structure. Although network fuzzing wasn't directly effective, it greatly helped us to master the tiny details of DDS. This led us to find an amplification vulnerability in the standard, which allows an attacker to redirect flood an arbitrary host. DDS configuration is highly dependent on XML, JSON, YAML, or similar formats, which make them another attack vector. By writing a Radamsa-based file fuzzer we found a parsing vulnerability in RTI DDS Connector, so an attacker can use a malicious configuration file to gain initial access. We then focus on fuzzing the message interpretation routines in all implementations. Using concrete examples, we explain how to pick good fuzz targets and prepare them for popular frameworks like OSS-Fuzz and UnicornAFL.  We take you from knowing nothing about DDS to efficiently researching new vulnerabilities, which we encourage other researchers, DDS users and implementors to do. We report on our interactions with some of the DDS implementors, which we believe is the first concrete step towards securing this critical protocol in the long run. We release fuzzing harnesses and a Scapy layer to decode the DDS RTPS layer.","tags":null,"title":"The Data Distribution Service (DDS) Protocol is Critical: Let's Use it Securely!","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Hello üëã\nAnd welcome to the first issue of the CyberFacts Weekly ü•≥\nI\u0026rsquo;ve started to systematically keep an archive of my readings since early 2021.

However, there's almost no security culture amongst robot makers.  Building a robot requires careful selection of components that interact across networks while meeting timing deadlines. It isn't uncommon for robot components to be compromised or fail over time, leading to complete system malfunction. Given the expensive prices of these machines (we focus on robots in the 25K-70K USD range), it's only reasonable to consider the need for securing and repairing robots.  We introduce and promote systematic \"robot teardown\" as an approach to repair robots by understanding their internals (still obscure). Needless to say, robot teardown is an essential practice in robot security. We show several \"tricks from the trade\" and the legal implications learned by porting reverse-engineering practices into the less-explored field of robotics. We explain how we a) discovered more than 90 security vulnerabilities in robots from Teradyne (MiR and UR) over a period of two years (never discussed publicly before), b) gained repairing capabilities on these robots, c) show evidence of planned obsolescence by comparing two sequentially released robot controllers, and d) demonstrate how robot hacking leads us to repurpose an older controller (previous version) from Universal Robots with their newer robots (arms) maintaining full capabilities and demonstrating that there's no need to re-spend thousands of dollars again.  Similar to Ford in the 1920s with cars, most robot manufacturers nowadays employ planned obsolescence practices and organize dealers and system integrators into \"private networks\", providing repair parts only to \"certified\" companies to make repairs more difficult and evade competition. We wrap up by advocating for a \"Right to Repair'' in robotics to reduce robot e-waste and promote systematic teardowns for the benefit of security research.","tags":null,"title":"Small Wonder: Uncovering Planned Obsolescence Practices in Robotics and What This Means for Cybersecurity","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi","Andrea Guglielmini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1617667200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630330372,"objectID":"b5eaaca38bb8740b663b22c827c9468e","permalink":"/publication/maggi_rfquack_tr_2021/","publishdate":"2021-04-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maggi_rfquack_tr_2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Software-defined radios (SDRs) are indispensable for signal reconnaissance and physical-layer dissection, but despite we have advanced tools like Universal Radio Hacker, SDR-based approaches require substantial effort.

However, they're not very flexible, as each dongle is a static hardware system with a monolithic firmware. We present RFquack, an open-source tool and library firmware that combines the flexibility of a software-based approach with the determinism and performance of embedded RF frontends.

While wearing a face mask we can\u0026rsquo;t speak properly and we can\u0026rsquo;t see others' mouth, so our experience of a conversation can change, especially if speaking is central in our lives (think of any public figure). Wearing a face mask impacts how we perceive others' emotions as well as our emotions (how we feel). Because our own understanding of our emotions can also influence such emotions in a continuous feedback loop, the effect can go beyond how we feel in that particular moment.\nTable of Contents  Summary How we Decode Emotions Through Facial Expressions Impact on our ability to speak and understand My Little Funky Experiment  Collecting data Through Amazon Mechanical Turk The importance of past experience: People we don\u0026rsquo;t know Results: How Good are we at Detecting Emotions from Facial Expressions? Results: How Fast do We Process Facial Expressions With and Without Masks?   Survival, adaptation, and crime Social impact of wearing masks and change in emotions A face mask can help you conceal unauthentic (or social) emotions Is Eye-only Emotion Communication Possible? How to better communicate when wearing masks? References Image Credits   Summary Given the central role of verbal and non-verbal communication in social interactions, if wearing a mask affects our abilities to communicate, our social interactions may be affected as well. Fortunately, there\u0026rsquo;s more than just facial features when judging someone\u0026rsquo;s emotions: Voice and body language can convey a good deal of information, which experienced public speakers known how to use to engage with the audience. The impact on social interactions of wearing a mask is hard to assess, however.\nI did a brief literature review and then decided to get my hands dirty and replicate some previous experiments on measuring our ability to assess others' emotions, using 45 participants that I recruited through the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform (for about $80), and publicly release the collected data (540 data points obtained from 6 headshots of a mid-age man wearing a mask and 6 headshots of a mid-age woman without mask).\nThe results are not completely in line with previous work: It seems that the batch of participants have performed better (10% better!) at assessing emotions on masked faces than on non-masked faces. This difference may be explained by multiple factors explained below, but my best bet is that Amazon Mechanical Turk workers are mainly profit driven and opportunistic, so they may just randomly click to answer as fast as they could. However, only one participant has clicked the sentinel answer (a deliberately wrong answer I purposely inserted), so, at least they have read the options. Also, I wanted to put the participants under time pressure, giving them only 60 seconds to answer: Actually, our brain is way faster to assess emotions from facial expressions, to the point that it\u0026rsquo;s a subconscious decision.\nOverall, when looking at faces, participants took 18.58394 ¬± 10.18913 seconds on average to take the wrong decision, about 3 seconds slower if compared to when they take a correct decision. The presence of a mask only slightly reflected on timing (16.46097 ¬± 8.86441 with mask vs. 16.23333 ¬± 9.44054 without mask), but correct decisions are taken about 3 seconds faster. This uncertainty has been found in previous work, too. Just for my own comparison (can\u0026rsquo;t possibly draw any conclusions here!), my 5 year old son never missed a shot when I showed him 6 masked faces and 6 non-masked faces, and took him 3.202 ¬± 1.469 seconds to assess emotions of non-masked faces vs. 5.364 ¬± 1.8593 when I showed masked faces. I know, I\u0026rsquo;m a proud father (very strong bias!) and it\u0026rsquo;s only one data point. Anyhow, despite the difference in the overall performance, both previous (strong and rigorous) research and my little funky experiment confirm that we tend to confuse sadness and disgust for other emotions (including neutral), which are the emotions that are mainly expressed by the muscles around our mouth. And very preliminary data (would be interesting to expand here) on young individuals show that they may be way better than we are at this task.\nStay safe and be happy: Wearing mask is essential to protect others‚Äîand ourselves, but primarily others! The price at stake here is much higher than a little confusion about others' emotion. Emotions are important, but life is more important! Don\u0026rsquo;t be dumb, don\u0026rsquo;t jump to conclusions (Pytlik, Soll, and Mehl, 2020)! Don\u0026rsquo;t be fooled by this article! Just wear a mask whenever you\u0026rsquo;re in public, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re closed to others but even no-one is around you, because social context has big impact on habits formation! And remember, it\u0026rsquo;s very hard to confusion happiness with any other emotions, even when wearing a mask. So, put a smile beneath your mask!\nHow we Decode Emotions Through Facial Expressions Although a recent study has identified up to 27 types of emotions (Cowen and Keltner, 2017), emotions can be roughly categorized into 6 buckets (Ekman, 1970): anger, disgust, fearless, happiness, neutral, sadness. We as humans process faces ‚Äúas a whole,‚Äù rather than processing individual features individually, and quickly (subconsciously) recognize what emotion the person we\u0026rsquo;re looking at is expressing‚Äîwhether it is the true emotion or not, that\u0026rsquo;s another story.\nThis happens even in cultures, such as Saudi Arabia, where veiling is the norm. Remember that certain people, like men and children, do not cover their faces, and women remove their veils at home or in female-only groups. So, humans of all cultures develop the same skills regardless of their public habits. But when we cannot see the whole face, such processing is forced to work with half the facial features (eye region).\nFortunately, each facial feature alone, however, can communicate certain emotions particularly well. The mouth region, for instance, is good for expressing feelings of happiness, although the eye region is also essential (as both previous work and my little experiment have showed). Interestingly, looking at the eye and mouth allows a finer-grained emotion categorization, ranging from sadness and fear (eyes are important here) to disgust and happiness (mouth is the dominant feature).\nImpact on our ability to speak and understand Another important aspect is that emotions are influenced by‚Äîand can influence‚Äîour ability to communicate. If we feel we can\u0026rsquo;t properly communicate, we may feel upset or simply uncomfortable that we can‚Äôt have a proper conversation because our words sound muffled. But audible speech is only one mean of communication: According to a recent article appeared on BBC News (Carys Betteley, 2020), members of the deaf community and others with hearing problems struggle if face mask wearing becomes common and widespread. But, let\u0026rsquo;s not forget that millions of women around the world wear face veils every day, with few apparent problems (Ong, 2020). What can we learn from women who veil their faces about how to communicate effectively? I\u0026rsquo;m quoting a couple of interviews by BBC reporter (Ong, 2020):\n Maria Ali, 34, a homemaker from Rawalpindi in Pakistan who wears a niqab, agrees. She says she has never had any problems communicating with other niqabi women, even ones who are strangers. ‚ÄúWith their gestures and voice, you can understand what they mean.‚Äù\nMarjaan Ali, 23, from Thuwal, Saudi Arabia observes that her facial expressions differ when she has the niqab on. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bit more exaggerated,‚Äù says the recent graduate. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôve noticed that over the years, I‚Äôve learnt to use my eyebrows quite expressively.‚Äù\n Although we can\u0026rsquo;t certainly generalize from these two quotes, it seems that as long as you learn to use (hand) gestures, voice, and eyes to emphasize your feelings, you can still communicate properly. I couple of times I noticing no reactions while smiling at someone during a conversation, to implicitly communicate my agreement. Moments later I realized I was wearing a mask, so I tried to use hands to do a ‚Äúthumbs up‚Äù sign, or use my eyes to emphasize the masked, nodding smile.\nMy Little Funky Experiment All researches conducted so far seem to confirm that masks prevent us from correctly assessing others' emotions. (Mike Rinck et al., 2020) recruited 91 participants, which showed altered emotion recognition for masked faces when recognizing disgust, fear, surprise, sadness, and happiness, but not anger or neutral expressions. Most of the confusion is on those emotions that share activation of the visible muscles in the upper half of the face. Participants frequently misinterpreted disgust as anger, and fear as surprise. Similarly, (Carbon, 2020) recruited 41 participant assessed the emotional expressions displayed by 12 different faces. Each face was randomly presented with the expressions of the 6 basic emotions while being fully visible or partly covered by a face mask. The researchers have found lower accuracy and lower confidence in recognizing emotions, indicating that emotional reading was strongly impaired by the mask. Specific confusion patterns occur in the case of misinterpreting disgusted faces as being angry, plus wrongly assessing many other emotions as neutral.\nAfter skimming through their results, I got intrigued and wanted to play around with some data as well. But reusing their data to draw the same pictures was not as exciting as repeating the experiment (on a smaller scale, of course). So I set off to work and prepared a survey.\nCollecting data Through Amazon Mechanical Turk This experiment does by no means substitute rigorous academic research, but after reading the work by (Mike Rinck et al., 2020) and (Carbon, 2020). I really became curious and wanted to create my own analysis. Of course the original survey by (Carbon, 2020) collected way more data than I did, and also made it available publicly. Last time I used Amazon Mechanical Turk was in 2014, so it was time for a quick refresh. It\u0026rsquo;s a powerful platform that allows anyone to quickly collect prepare experiments that require human intelligence and collect data. In about 14 hours I collected 540 data points and that costed me only $80. Of course it\u0026rsquo;s not the same as running in-lab experiments. If you\u0026rsquo;re using Amazing Mechanical Turk, remember to insert test questions (to discard results clearly coming from random, profit-driven clicks) and by choosing to assign tasks only to so-called Master Workers‚Äîwhich are workers with a positive historical record of approved high-quality tasks. There\u0026rsquo;s a simple intro-level tutorial that guides you through all the technical steps required to setup and run a survey.\n Facial expressions I used in the experiment: anger, disgust, fear, happyness, neutral, sad.    Figure 1 shows the pictures I used in the experiment for each of the 6 universal emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sad. I know, I combined two controlled variables in a single experiment (sex and presence of a mask), and that\u0026rsquo;s not a recommended experimental protocol. However, my time and resources were limited, and most of all I\u0026rsquo;m doing this just for fun and to play around with some data collection and analysis tools. I obtained the data from the FACES dataset (Ebner, Riediger, and Lindenberger, 2010) and I artificially applied a face mask on the pictures of the male model.\nThe importance of past experience: People we don\u0026rsquo;t know I decided to present images to each worker in random order, one at a time, not all at the same time. Why? Because I wanted to emulate the worst-case condition. Here\u0026rsquo;s the rationale: If I know a person I know their ‚Äúnormal‚Äù face or ‚Äúangry‚Äù face very well. But if we look at the neutral face above (second from the right), are we 100% that couldn\u0026rsquo;t that be her angry or sad face? If I see the whole context then I have way more context to cast the correct decision‚Äîespecially if I know there are 6 emotion types.\nIn other words, if I know a person, even when that person wears a mask, I can easily tell their emotions apart. But I was more interested in emulating the ‚Äúrandom stranger‚Äù condition: Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re walking on the street and a person you\u0026rsquo;ve never seen before walks toward you with a sad-looking face‚Äîor angry-looking face, who knows! How good are you at telling those two very different emotions apart? Anger and sadness are quite different emotions, but because of the mask and the complete lack of past experience you simply can\u0026rsquo;t guess. It\u0026rsquo;s the worst-case condition and I wanted to emulate exactly that.\nFollowing the same line of thought, I decided to impose a 60s time constrain for workers to complete each task (1 face). Why is timing important? Because when we glance at someone\u0026rsquo;s face we make unconscious decisions and those are quite fast. (Carbon, 2020) gave the participants ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù time to complete the task and collected a conscious assessment of their ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù in their decision. I decided to focus on a fast task, because at the end of the day, that\u0026rsquo;s how our brain works when we see someone.\nResults: How Good are we at Detecting Emotions from Facial Expressions? As the following figure shows, I obtained mixed results, sometimes opposite from what previous (and more thorough) work has found. In most of the times, as the green diagonal shows, the emotions where correctly classified, with more confusion in the masked case (bottom row). In particular, we notice that happiness is a ‚Äústrong‚Äù emotion, in the sense that it almost never got misclassified (only 4 cases out of 270 in the masked condition, and zero cases in the unmasked condition). So, smile whenever you can! Sadness and disgust are particularly challenging emotions, especially in the masked condition, and neutral got misclassified 10% of the times for other emotions‚Äîmainly anger‚Äîin the unmasked condition. Surprisingly, neutral emotions appear more neutral in the masked condition. Does masks make us all appear more serious? Maybe!\n Confusion matrix showing the number of correct detections for each combination of real-detected emotions. The greener, the better.   The overall performance for correctly detecting facial emotions in faces without masks was 70.00% (while 89.5% in (Carbon, 2020)). Presenting a different face (to reduce the effects of learning, or simply cheating) resulted in a 79.25%. Yes, the workers‚Äîassuming they didn\u0026rsquo;t cheat (and that\u0026rsquo;s a big assumption)‚Äîperformed better when presented with masked faces. This is the opposite of what (Carbon, 2020) found, but I\u0026rsquo;m skeptical of my own data. There may be various explanations and the only way to give a clear answer is to repeat the experiments several times, but I simply don\u0026rsquo;t have enough time to dig further, so I\u0026rsquo;m just providing some wild guesses. Maybe someone will do some followup work.\n  Small sample and multiple controlled variables: to keep the investment below $100, I had to reduce the number of stimuli to 1 mid-age man for masked faces, 1 mid-age woman for non-masked faces, while the original study has employed all variants (male vs. female w/ and w/o mask): it\u0026rsquo;s an experimental mistake to combine multiple variables, because now we don\u0026rsquo;t know whether the reason is that the non-masked woman model was less expressive or, vice-versa, the masked man had very expressive eyes;\n  Time: the time pressure may have forced the workers to simply cast a random choice or the workers may have taken the tasks in a very opportunistic way. However, if we pivot the data, we see that, overall, they make sense (see the timing analysis below).\n  We\u0026rsquo;ve grown accustomed to this! Hey, let\u0026rsquo;s look at the bright side of it: the 45 participants may have gotten better at assessing emotions by looking at the eyes only. Not really sure this is the case, but I gave it a thought for a moment.\n  Lots of open questions and little time to continue this research. But it was fun to learn how to deploy this type of studies from scratch. Next time I\u0026rsquo;ll certainly think twice and/or invest more resources to conduct wider studies. Let\u0026rsquo;s move onto the timing analysis now.\nResults: How Fast do We Process Facial Expressions With and Without Masks? My 5 year old son never misclassified a facial expression when I showed him 6 masked faces and 6 non-masked faces, and took him 3.202 ¬± 1.469 seconds to assess emotions of non-masked faces vs. 5.364 ¬± 1.8593 when I showed masked faces. This initial home experiment got me into thinking I should look at the time spent by the workers to complete their task. Big warning: this time includes the time required to click on the next page, wait for the page to load, and finally click on the ‚Äúsubmit‚Äù button. So, let\u0026rsquo;s look at it but take it with a grain of salt.\nAs we can see from Figure 3, regardless of whether one\u0026rsquo;s wearing a mask, correct detections overall take about 3 second less than incorrect ones (15.60794 ¬± 8.65164 versus 18.58394 ¬± 10.18913). Also, we can see that participants who didn\u0026rsquo;t detect the correct emotion from facial expressions spent a highly variable time staring at the picture, while timing for correct detections are more densely distributed around mean values.\n Overall time to detect facial emotions in case of correct (blue) and incorrect (false) detections.   Looking at the breakdown in Figure 4 we see that the mask condition (bottom row) almost always means the subject will spend some more time to look at the picture and still make the incorrect guess. Some facial expressions seem to create more confusion than others: look at fear or neutral for example. When presented with unmasked facial expressions (upper row), the subject will spend roughly the same amount of time, regardless of the outcome (correct vs. incorrect), while in the bottom row we see more diverse cases.\n Breakdown on real emotions displayed on the stimuli.   Survival, adaptation, and crime Since our earliest days, human beings have been incredibly attuned to reading the facial expressions of others. This ability likely conferred upon us an evolutionary advantage, Charles Darwin (Darwin, 1872)Learning how to read emotions from a face could aid social interaction, reduce misunderstandings and help a group function efficiently and harmoniously for the greater good, said (Ong, 2020).\n Eilidh Noyes, lecturer in cognitive psychology at the University of Huddersfield in northern England said that\n When you see a face you do two things at once. You try to work out the identity: Do I know them? How do I know them? And you try to read their emotions. [\u0026hellip;] Emotion recognition is important from an evolutionary perspective as it helps us gauge threat and can also facilitate positive social interactions. That‚Äôs true of both people we know well and those we have never met.\n Similarly, Ian H. Robertson, professor of psychology at Trinity College Dublin said that\n For survival reasons, you need to know what someone‚Äôs intentions are when you meet them. Not being able to do that easily will naturally make people more cautious and defensive, which in some cases could, unfortunately, lead to violent confrontations.\n Source: (CORDIS, 2020).\nUnderstanding others' emotion has been a matter of survival, but not as much as in ancient times. So there\u0026rsquo;s no doubt it\u0026rsquo;s important to assess emotions correctly, but only in certain, very extreme situations, when normally there are other clues available: A loud screaming voice to signal emergency would be understood as fear no matter what. So, overall, I don\u0026rsquo;t agree with this line of thoughts and I consider it very borderline if not biased.\nI do agree with the fact that with mask becoming the norm there is the potential for exploitation by those with criminal intentions.\n The main problem that people wearing masks throws up is the sheer volume of people suddenly covering their faces\n said Francis Dodsworth, senior lecturer in criminology at Kingston University London.\n It could create opportunities for people who want to cover their face for nefarious reasons. They could potentially now do so without raising suspicion.\nConcealing faces will also have widespread implications for crime and security. A lot of witnessing is already problematic. Even when a group of people witness the same crime, one person will see someone with a mustache and a hat, while another will see someone with a beard and sunglasses.‚Äù\n Source: (CORDIS, 2020)\nSocial impact of wearing masks and change in emotions I still feel a little strange when wearing a mask, but my rational part is now in full control of those mixed emotion, and I simply forget I\u0026rsquo;m wearing a mask at times. In May, Kate Gray, who researches emotion processing at the University of Reading in the UK, mentioned that adapting to a faceless society will be a smooth process: ‚Äú[\u0026hellip;] we‚Äôll quite quickly get used to picking up social and emotional cues from voice cues or body language.‚Äù\nI remember that the first time I saw my father wearing a mask it felt very strange. And when I started wearing a mask and people around me wouldn\u0026rsquo;t, I felt even stranger‚Äîlike I was over-reacting. I bet I wasn\u0026rsquo;t the only one feeling strange, and an early research appeared earlier this year scientifically confirmed that the simple exposure to social groups of mask wearers greatly reduces that strange feeling (Carbon, 2020). The researchers have asked 86 participants to assess how strange they felt when wearing a mask (i.e., simple surgery mask, FFP2 mask, and loop scarfs) among other mask wearers, in groups of varying size. The larger the social group, the less strange each member feels about themselves.\nSo, one part of the impact on emotion seems to be that wearing masks makes us feel a little different, triggers different or slightly different emotions. When we wear a mask we‚Äôre left only with the eyes, and that can make it difficult for people to make these judgments. According to Leslie Zebrowitz, psychology professor who studies facial perception at Brandeis University, told that ‚ÄúWe feel more comfortable when we feel that we‚Äôre able to assess what someone is like‚Äù (CORDIS, 2020).\nA face mask can help you conceal unauthentic (or social) emotions Here\u0026rsquo;s another line of thoughts I tend to agree with, probably because I\u0026rsquo;m introvert. We‚Äîintrovers‚Äîwon\u0026rsquo;t be showing our true emotions anyhow, with or without mask, so why bother? We don‚Äôt have to be happy to smile, and we don‚Äôt always smile when we‚Äôre happy. This can vary greatly across cultures. In the United States, smiling is part of the etiquette, while a Russian proverb translates as ‚Äúsmiling with no reason is a sign of stupidity.‚Äù In Japan, emotions are stifled in public, there‚Äôs a greater emphasis on smiling with the eyes, so Japanese people may be able to convey‚Äîand read‚Äîtheir emotions through facial expressions more effectively.\nTara Well, Associate Professor of Psychology at Barnard College of Columbia University, recently wrote a short thought piece about the social smile (Tara Well, 2020). She wrote that:\n The social smile is activated in the mouth muscles only and, therefore, easily covered up by a face mask. But a genuine smile, known as the Duchenne smile, named after the French anatomist who discovered it, involves both the mouth and the eyes. Interestingly, the facial muscle engaged by a genuine smile, called the orbicularis oculi, can‚Äôt be activated on command. You can see an authentic smile in the crinkles around the eyes.\nAccording to this, the face mask only hides the fake smiles, not the authentic ones. Think about it: when you\u0026rsquo;re truly smiling (close to laughing), extending your mouth isn\u0026rsquo;t enough. On the other hand, when you make a forced smile, it\u0026rsquo;s istantaneous, and it only involves the muscles around your mouth. Prof. T. Well continues explaining how, for some personality types, wearing a mask may even have a beneficial impact in their emotional space:\nThose suffering from social anxiety may welcome wearing face masks precisely because they prefer to veil their emotional state from the outside world as much as possible. [\u0026hellip;] Others appreciate the freedom from the obligation to put others at ease with a warm, friendly smile. By wearing a face mask, you don‚Äôt have to smile if you don‚Äôt feel like it.\nWe learn when to show and hide our genuine emotions from early face-to-face exchanges. Parents instinctively want to shield their children from negative social experiences. So they reward emotional displays that will encourage and facilitate acceptance from others. Children learn to behave in specific ways to receive social approval. Part of this process is developing a social smile to hide unacceptable emotions. (see book on negative factors of this).\nThe social smile is often activated automatically. We may not be fully aware of it. We might smile reflexively to put the brakes on showing too much negative emotion in public. We may maintain a calm, relaxed smile to prevent fear from upwelling and getting the best of us. We can also intentionally use the social smile to pepper our communication‚Äîlike smiling, assuringly at someone who appears suspicious of us.\n I\u0026rsquo;m among those who ‚Äúsuffer‚Äù when the social ‚Äúnorm‚Äù ask us to smile or simply for an emotion, so I like this viewpoint. An Asian friend a few years ago told me some Asian people cover their faces with a mask or scarf loop not only during flu season, but simply beacuse they don\u0026rsquo;t always want to show their mouth area or full face in public. Whether or not that\u0026rsquo;s a bias in his social circle, I sometimes feel the same.\nIs Eye-only Emotion Communication Possible? Shakespeare said that the eyes were the windows to the soul. Indeed, eyes alone can provide a great deal of information. Nigel Holt, Professor of Psychology at Aberystwyth University recently wrote (Holt, 2020) that ‚Äúwe are wired to extract information from the eyes‚Äîinformation that can help us assess the emotions of those around us and so allow us to engage more effectively with them.‚Äù Eyes alone can be quite effective, as (Lee and Anderson, 2017) showed. They showed volunteers images of eyes expressing different emotions (sadness, disgust, anger, joy, surprise, fear) and found out that the participants were able to correctly guess the mental states to the ‚Äúeye expression‚Äù. From this research it emerged that different aspects of the eyes (such as how open they are or how sloped the brow is) give information about different mental states.\nEye contact is also essential in social interactions as well as in the emotions that gazing at eye level can trigger. (Guastella, Mitchell, and Dadds, 2008) showed images of faces to people who are given oxytocin, and found out that they spend more time looking at the eyes than those given a placebo. Since oxytocin is a factor in social interactions, this finding suggests the eyes are very important in how we understand our engagement and interaction with those around us. Indeed, people with high levels of oxytocin appear to seek out the eyes to help them better engage socially with others.\nFrom a perception viewpoint, we know that we are exceptionally sensitive to very tiny changes in direction of gaze, because the center of our retina is densely populated with light receptors. But a recent study showed that this goes beyond just sensitivity and perception. When we try to assess which direction someone is looking in, it significantly activates our amygdala, a part of the brain associated with emotion. So there seems to be a link between emotion and eyes at a neurological level (Kawashima et al., 1999).\nWhen eyes are the only feature available the role of the context could be crucial, but there\u0026rsquo;s no strong evidence about this.(Kret and de Gelder, 2012) tested whether emotions can be recognized when just the eyes are visible and whether this recognition is affected by context cues (e.g., various Islamic headdresses vs. a cap or a scarf). The results are that fear is still well recognized from a briefly flashed (100 ms) image of a women wearing a burqa with less than 20% transparency of the eye region.\nLast, let me bring up a different viewpoint on eye-only emotion communication. It\u0026rsquo;s somewhat common belief that if someone is ‚Äúlooking up and to the right‚Äù when they are talking then they may be lying. (Wiseman et al., 2012) filmed a group of people telling true and false stories, and then asked another group to try to spot the lies by looking at the speakers‚Äô eyes. This experiment found no evidence for a link between lying and eye movements at all. So, eye-only emotion communication is possible, but not as reliable as one may think.\nHow to better communicate when wearing masks? Some healthcare workers on the frontline have attached¬†smiley-faced pictures¬†of themselves onto their medical gowns, trying to ease patient anxiety (Ong, 2020). That\u0026rsquo;s one practical and simple way to show your best emotion (happyness) when people around you need that. Especially when we can\u0026rsquo;t talk, I don\u0026rsquo;t see any better way than that.\nBut when we can talk and move freely, it\u0026rsquo;s a whole different story. Psychologist Al Zayer suggests that, when wearing a mask, we should strive to over-communicate, use more words than we normally would, and ask more questions, to make sure we\u0026rsquo;re picking up on the other person‚Äôs emotions. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that what professional radio speakers or podcast creators do? They can convey very deep emotions and many shades of emotions by using their voice only. Normally, facial expressions form part of a coordinated set of features‚Äîincluding hand gestures, body language, words, pitch and tone, and even face colour (Benitez-Quiroz, Srinivasan, and Martinez, 2018). All of these features act together to convey message, intent, and emotions. And the best part is that, for some people, this is all natural. No training needed!\nI want to close with a fun fact. There are prototypes of a voice-activated mask, currently in the crowdfunding stages (Georgia Coggan, 2020). The mask uses LED lights to display emotion or words. The LED lights can mimic the mouth movements, with simple commands like ‚Äúpopping the lips‚Äù to display simple words, emojis or smiles.\nThe artificial mouth tracks the mouth of the user, emulating the physical action of the lips. It\u0026rsquo;s a matter of time and someone will make the flexible OLED version of that, showing a full, high-resolution picture of your mouth area recorded in real time from a micro-camera with IR illuminators positioned inside the mask.\nFor now, I\u0026rsquo;m sticking to the old-school approach.\nReferences  Baron-Cohen, Simon, Sally Wheelwright, Jacqueline Hill, Yogini Raste, and Ian Plumb. ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòReading the Mind in the Eyes‚Äô Test Revised Version: A Study with Normal Adults, and Adults with Asperger Syndrome or High-Functioning Autism.‚Äù The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines 42, no. 2 (February 2001): 241‚Äì51. https://doi.org/10/fdwnm3.

A rocky mountain I seldom find myself brave enough to start climbing (unless forced to). I\u0026rsquo;ve never had good reading habits, except for a few, very intriguing novels with a powerful storyline, which I could actually read quite fast. But most of the readings I wish I could get done quickly are damn hard. In the era of book-summarizing services like Blinkist, audiobooks, and \u0026ldquo;CEO reading guides,\u0026rdquo; where people invest time and money to compress time and read more, my limited reading abilities are an actual obstacle to my knowledge development. How did I change that? I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I did, but here is what I found by experimenting on myself.\n In short: I got significantly better a reading when I started reading aloud, record my voice, and share partial audio files with friends, who told me they ejoyed listening to my recordings, and that helped them stay motivated. The power of social incentives!\n   The Joy Pain of Reading  Could I Motivate Myself to Read More?  Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation  The Microphone that Brought in New Incentives  Read for Someone Else (Your Age)  The Turning Point: Helping and Motivating Others  Seeing Progress  The TEDx Talk That Made Me Write This  References  The Joy Pain of Reading It all begun about a month ago, when I needed to read more books to dig into a new subject. I had a pile of books staring at me and I simply couldn\u0026rsquo;t find enough courage to get started. I\u0026rsquo;ve always been a very lazy reader, cherry picking the content I needed to get my job done and only seldom enjoying what others called \u0026ldquo;the joy of reading\u0026rdquo;. Few exceptions aside, that \u0026ldquo;joy\u0026rdquo; was actually a frustrating pain.\nMost of the papers and other technical resources I had read during my academic career had been an authentic pain, with only a few exceptions. I do a decent amount of reviewing work, both internal (not public, for the company I work for) and external (I sit in some conferences review boards or technical commitees), and because of how review-oriented reading works, I pause reading very often to think about what I\u0026rsquo;ve just read, take notes, etc. So, slow reading, mostly. Truth is, I actually read a lot, but mainly because I have to, and I don\u0026rsquo;t quite realize how much I read. Possibly, this may have have created a negative bias about my actual reading abilities, to the point that starting and continuing a reading to the end is hard. Once I\u0026rsquo;m engaged, I get going, but getting started and concluding are the hardest parts.\nCould I Motivate Myself to Read More? The Web is filled with \u0026ldquo;how to motivate yourself to do X, Y, Z\u0026rdquo; guides. Ironically, these many and diverse guides on the same subject not only means that people find them useful, but also that there are enough instances of X, Y, Z problems to make these guides worth existing! In simple words, many people suffer from X, Y, Z problems. So, you\u0026rsquo;re not alone. This post is not meant to be yet another of such guides, but just a summary of my recent experience.\nImportant: I\u0026rsquo;m not writing this post as a result of following one of those X, Y, Z guides. Actually, I found about a generic \u0026ldquo;how to motivate yourself\u0026rdquo; guide, not about reading, which made me realize and reflect about the reasons why I\u0026rsquo;ve been reading more in the past month. I\u0026rsquo;m writing this in a retrospective way, not biased by the content of the guide I found. The guide\u0026mdash;which I\u0026rsquo;ll share below\u0026mdash;was helpful because it helped me understand the reasons of the change I had already embraced, without even noticing that.\nIntrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation If you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with the basics of psychology, you know that there exist two, broad types of motivation in incentive theories: intrinsic (internal) motivation and extrinsic (external) motivation, and the latter is less powerful than the the former. When you\u0026rsquo;re intrinsically motivated to do something everything seems easy and smooth. For example, if you love your job you don\u0026rsquo;t perceive it as a due duty. If you like to play chess or cards, you look forward to play, regardless of any prizes. The prizes are external incentives that drive extrinsic motivation. By the way, that\u0026rsquo;s how I interpret the last minute of The Queen\u0026rsquo;s Gambit: \u0026ldquo;sygrayem!\u0026quot;\nIntrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation play an important role in education. If educators are able to find and trigger intrinsic incentive mechanisms\u0026mdash;for instance by engaging the students with practical activities, involving them as part of the teaching experience\u0026mdash;then the students are more likely to get intrinsically motivated to dig deeper into a subject\u0026hellip;for the sake of it! Students perform better with a good balance of intrinsic vs. extrinsic rewards, but both are necessary. Extrinsic rewards are often visible to others, so they become part of social interactions. Yes, I\u0026rsquo;m talking about grades. In the perfect system you study because you like the way the teacher teaches a subject, you get good grades (and you feel good the moment you get that reward!), other see those good grades and feel motivated to get good grades as well! On the other hand, if you only get extrinsic incentives\u0026mdash;grades only\u0026mdash;you won\u0026rsquo;t feel as good as when you get an intrinsic incentive, even when the grades are outstanding.\nBack to readings, when you get sucked into a novel or a story in the news, and want to continue reading, that\u0026rsquo;s your intrinsic motivation at play. You almost don\u0026rsquo;t perceive that you\u0026rsquo;re reading, you get so immersed that it\u0026rsquo;s almost like flying through the words. That\u0026rsquo;s what happened, very few cases, honestly (I should be pickier while choosing books!), when I found a book that was a true joy to read. There are many online social networks about readings (e.g., Goodreads, Anobii), which, in addition to recommending good books based on your past readings, show how much others are reading. So, they make external (social) incentive factors into play: \u0026ldquo;look at how much your friend is reading\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried some of them, but they never worked on me: I\u0026rsquo;m so slow at reading anyways that my social circle appears to be so far off me that I ended up closing the accounts because I found those numbers very depressing. Meh!\nThe Microphone that Brought in New Incentives At the beginning of the first lockdown I purchased a decent (not professional) microphone, because what I had ahead of me was, heh, lots of virtual conferences! I got myself a Trust GTX 252+, which, considering the price range ($90\u0026ndash;100), has a quite good, warm sound.\nAfter recording the first presentation\u0026mdash;and get disappointed about the very scarce conference attendance\u0026mdash;I started to ponder how I could use that microphone in other ways. If you have small kids you know that doing actual work during lockdown is just a bliss. But small kids are a gold mine of opportunities and unexpected surprises. In this case my older one asked me to read him a book. He had \u0026ldquo;read\u0026rdquo; (through me and his mom) probably more than I\u0026rsquo;ve ever done in 6\u0026ndash;7 times his age. This time I told him: \u0026ldquo;do you want to record the reading so you can share with your cousin?\u0026quot; And so I started recording my voice while reading his books, along with his (quite funny and entertaining) comments. We both enjoyed the activity, which we continued for about a month. Here you can see both an intrinsic incentive (reading became fun for both) as well as a social incentive (his cousin was happy to listen to his books whenever he wanted).\nImportant: Commercial and/or professional recording of copyrighted material should adhere to copyright laws as well as follow any additional licenses that come with the material in question; so, if you ever think about doing this professionally, I recommend that you think about starting a career as an audiobook narrator.\nRead for Someone Else (Your Age) At this point you could be thinking that reading child books is painless\u0026mdash;to someone like with with poor reading habits\u0026mdash;because they\u0026rsquo;re short. True! And extremely boring to most adults, I\u0026rsquo;d say. Especially if you\u0026rsquo;ve been reading them every, single, day at bedtime for the past year or so. That\u0026rsquo;s probably why I stopped doing that after about a month üòÜ\nMeanwhile, about one month ago I started reading about Hermann Ebbinghaus' research on memory, and in particular about spaced repetitions, a technique that he experimented on himself to memorize long lists of nonsense syllables. I was particularly intrigued by the fact that he used to read the target pseudowords aloud. And I had recetly learned about how the phonological loop of working memory works:\n Subvocal rehearsal loop (source: Oxford reference)\nOne of the two components of the phonological loop of working memory, functioning to keep information from decaying by mental repetition, and also translating visual information into phonological code where necessary for short-term memory. Also called an articulatory loop, an articulatory rehearsal loop, or an articulatory store.\n So, putting all the pieces together, I decided to run an experiment on myself: I read aloud one chapter of a book I was reading, used my new shiny microphone and Audacity to record my voice, and I\u0026rsquo;ll listen to myself reading while doing other tasks, to see if I could memorize it better. I know, this does not replicate Ebbinghaus experiment, but bare with me, because at the end of the story this turns out to be just a pretext.\nAt a first glance, here\u0026rsquo;s what I recall I felt:\n I felt extremely good and committed, from the very first words I spoke; I could see the progress of my speech on the screen and the read pages quickly flipping; I felt focused and distraction free.  I thought it was a very good start and I didn\u0026rsquo;t even know what was coming!\nThe Turning Point: Helping and Motivating Others Almost for fun, I shared the recorded audio among my reading group, just to hear their thoughts. When I shared the MP3 file among my friends, they inundated me with many thank-you messages and lots of blinky emojis. One of them in particular was the key, the turning point. They said:\n That\u0026rsquo;s awesome üòç I felt so lost these days, now you gave me a guiding voice to listen to, and I can do that when I do my jogging! Thank you!!!!\n See that? That closed the loop! The fact that I was helping someone (BTW, a total stranger, because we run this reading group remotely among strangers!) to stay motivated is what motivated me most! I could almost envision this person doing their activities while listening to my \u0026ldquo;guiding voice\u0026rdquo; (I think that was the most powerful phrase). I felt what I was doing had positive value for someone, and that was the best, instantaneous reward I could get.\nA powerful social incentive!\nSeeing Progress Remember when I said that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t incentivized to use Goodreads \u0026amp; friends because I felt slow at reading compared to my social circle? It turned out I was faster than I thought, and I could monitor my progress pretty quickly by looking at the folder where I kept my recordings on my computer. And those lists have been growing constantly on daily basis, and so the compliments I received by my reading group, thanking me for what I was doing.\nSeeing progress is the third ingredient towards behavior change. When we see the cumulative result of our work, we\u0026rsquo;re motivated to keep our behavior in that direction. But progress has to be measurable with an adequately-fine-grained unit. If you\u0026rsquo;re a lazy reader like me, and you\u0026rsquo;re measuring yourself by the number of books you read, then you\u0026rsquo;re stuck.\nThe TEDx Talk That Made Me Write This So, why am I writing this? Just because I wanted to share? Nah! I mean, yes, but not only that. Yesterday I watched this TEDx Cambridge talk by Prof. Tali Sharot, a cognitive neuroscientist at UCL.\n   Prof. Sharot summarizes that it\u0026rsquo;s hard to change our behavior because most of our incentive programs are designed to threaten us by showing us all the bad things that could happen if we don\u0026rsquo;t adopt that behavior, while her experiments show that the opposite incentive program is much more powerful (we\u0026rsquo;re talking about 15% vs 90%!). So, instead of bombard our kids with things like \u0026ldquo;if you don\u0026rsquo;t read enough you\u0026rsquo;ll get bad grades\u0026rdquo; (which is what I\u0026rsquo;ve been bombarded with), let\u0026rsquo;s tell them \u0026ldquo;if you read you\u0026rsquo;ll become the fastest reader in the world\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s intuitive, I know, but if you think about it, it\u0026rsquo;s quite hard to implement. Why? Because you have to design a good reward system around it, which should show immediate positive rewards over time. And that\u0026rsquo;s not always practical.\nSo, the reason why I\u0026rsquo;m writing this piece is because Prof. Sharot\u0026rsquo;s talk enlightened me by showing all the ingredients that I already had on my plate, which were already at work to keep me motivated, but was quite nice to see them all condensed in that 15-minutes engaging talk, backed by scientific research!\nOverall, a good way to change your behavior consists of these steps:\n use positive reward as opposed to negative, threatening scenarios; by the way, this teaches a good lesson to many industry fields, which often makes use of FUD to spread supposedly convincing marketing messages and incentivize prospects to purchase more; and yes, that\u0026rsquo;s why disinformation spreads so well as opposed to clear, fact-based information. bring in social incentives, so that you can see how others perceive your performance as well as compare yourself with others; find a way to monitor your progress as fast as possible, to get you immediate, measurable rewards; delayed rewards don\u0026rsquo;t work well, or they should be broken down into smaller, spaced rewards.

Despite the market is driving towards integrated and interconnected factories, current smartmanufacturing systems are still designed under the assumption that they will stay isolated from the corporatenetwork and the outside world. This choice may result in an internal architecture with insufficient network andsystem compartmentalization. As a result, once an attacker has gained access, they have full control of the entireproduction plant because of the lack of network segmentation.With the goal of raising cybersecurity awareness, in this paper we describe a practical case study showing attackscenarios that we have validated on a real modular smart manufacturing system, and suggest practical securitycountermeasures. The testbed smart manufacturing system is part of the Industry 4.0 research laboratory hosted byPolitecnico di Milano, and comprises seven assembly stations, each with their programmable logic controllers andhuman-computer interfaces, as well as an industrial robotic arm that performs pick-and-place tasks.On this testbed we show two indirect attacks to gain initial access, even under the best-case scenario of a system notdirectly connected to any public network. We conclude by showing two post-exploitation scenarios that an adversarycan use to cause physical impact on the production, or keep persistent access to the plant.We are unaware of a similar security analysis performed within the premises of a research facility, following ascientific methodology, so we believe that this work can represent a good first step to inspire follow up research onthe many verticals that we touch.","tags":null,"title":"Smart Factory Security: A Case Study on a Modular SmartManufacturing System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1603238400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600085292,"objectID":"0afaa66ece55aeb460efdf933b05333d","permalink":"/talk/maggi_smscs3sthlm_talk_2020/","publishdate":"2020-10-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/maggi_smscs3sthlm_talk_2020/","section":"talk","summary":"Last year we performed a security analysis on a testbed smart manufacturing system using a variety of \"unconventional\" attack vectors. Striving to think very much outside the box, we wanted to understand which overlooked conditions and attacker capabilities make certain attacks possible, and their consequences.  Through concrete PoCs, we'll describe what unconventional attack vectors and very creative attackers can achieve, as well as how they can be stopped by current security solutions.  We'll first show how a remote attacker can indirectly compromise an engineering workstation to backdoor the automation logic of an industrial robot. Then, we'll reveal how the attack has been carried out via a malicious software extension that targets the simulation and offline programming (OLP) platform. The attendees will learn that such malicious extensions have full capabilities on the target system, but we'll explain what they are and how they can be stopped.  Our second entry point is an industry-grade embedded device. These devices, often dubbed as \"IIoT devices\" offer great programming flexibility‚Äîcompared to, say, PLCs‚Äîat the price of more responsibility for the programmers. The proliferation of customizable IIoT devices along with the many 3rd-party development libraries are the perfect target for software supply-chain attacks. We'll show how we trojanized a simple temperature-measurement library to implement an ARP-based DoS attack, along with inaccurate temperature data-points, which can cause cascade effects down the data-processing pipeline. We'll argue that detecting violations in the software supply-chain is hard in large, distributed enterprises, but their effects can be mitigated with proper network partitioning.  The last step of our security analysis focused on lateral movements to complex, programmable machines such as industrial robots. We observe that, movement-instructions aside, industrial robot programming languages have statements, loops, conditions, network sockets, serial communication, etc. With access to low-level system resources like files, network, memory, and peripherals, task programs are a powerful, overlooked payload. Not only we show that task programs are susceptible to input-validation vulnerabilities, we also show that they're rich enough to implement malware-like functionalities, given that the runtime environment provides no resource isolation. As a result, task programs have unmediated access to the entire system.  We'll share cases of vulnerable and malicious task programs, and how to discover such patterns, including some vulnerabilities we found in real-world code.  We conclude by discussing the remediation steps that can be adopted by developers and vendors to mitigate our findings in the medium and long term.","tags":null,"title":"Hidden Attack Surfaces of Modern Industrial Automation Systems","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Marcello Pogliani","Federico Maggi","Marco Balduzzi","Davide Quarta","Stefano Zanero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1601856000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591541701,"objectID":"da4bcca57101ef1ab9760e00b6affbad","permalink":"/publication/pogliani_otrazor_2020/","publishdate":"2020-06-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pogliani_otrazor_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"To appear","tags":null,"title":"Detecting Unsafe Code Patterns in Industrial Robot Programs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi","Marcello Pogliani","Davide Quarta","Stefano Zanero","Marco Balduzzi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1599868800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600085292,"objectID":"2abc41f6063986ef31bc19e360e10c5a","permalink":"/talk/maggi_otrazorhitcon_talk_2020/","publishdate":"2020-09-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/maggi_otrazorhitcon_talk_2020/","section":"talk","summary":"What if a perfectly patched industrial manufacturing machine can still harbor for vulnerabilities where no one is looking?

Recent incidents such as the ransomware infection that halted production at a major semiconductor foundry in 2018 have already shown the impact of IT-to-OT lateral movement. Moreover, while smart manufacturing systems are isolated from other networks, there is a trend toward less isolation between IT and OT systems.\nMy personal advise is to learn how to think as an attacker. Knowing the current threats and countermeasures is indispensable, but you need to run an extra mile and strive to think about other ways that such a complex system can get compromised.\nIn this series of brief videos, I\u0026rsquo;ll go through a recent paper that I worked on: a collaborative research between Trend Micro Research and Politecnico di Milano.\nEp. 1: Introduction to Smart Manufacturing Security In this video we start by taking a look at how a smart manufacturing system actually looks like, using the system that we have used during our research. Although it\u0026rsquo;s an educational lab, it uses the same equipment used in real modern factories.\n   There are 7 stations, each controlled by a dedicated PLC and an HMI for the operator to interact with the system, for maintenance or troubleshooting for example. The goal of the plant is to produce cell phones (actually, toy cell phones) with a case and a printed circuit board inside. The whole system is controlled by a so-called MES (or manufacturing execution system) which is a scheduling software that make sure that each PLC receives the right control command at the right time, and that all the parts needed to produce an item are available.\nThe SIEMENS equipment (such as the HMIs and PLCs) communicate via S7, which is a proprietary control protocol by SIEMENS. The MES and other components communicate via Modbus and OPC Unified Architecture, which is an open machine-to-machine protocol for industrial automation There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of \u0026ldquo;backstage\u0026rdquo; work done by the engineers who setup these systems, which is normally carried out by the so-called \u0026ldquo;engineering workstation\u0026rdquo;: it\u0026rsquo;s a computer with industrial automation programming software installed, normally directly connected to all the machines.\nAlthough the trend is towards more and more connected smart manufacturing systems, we\u0026rsquo;re assuming a conservative scenario, in which none of these systems is directly reachable from the Internet.\nWe conclude the video with the questions that we wanted to answer with this research:\n Under which conditions are certain attacks possible, and what is their impact? Of course even a simple ransomware or any other \u0026ldquo;traditional\u0026rdquo; IT attacks can have repercussions on the OT environment, even if that wasn\u0026rsquo;t the primary goal of the attacker. But we\u0026rsquo;re more interested in attacks against the specific smart-manufacturing technology Are there any overlooked attack vectors that could make the attacker\u0026rsquo;s job easier? We\u0026rsquo;re interested in non-mainstream opportunities, or techniques that attackers could use to \u0026ldquo;fly under the radar\u0026rdquo; or that we think they\u0026rsquo;ll use in the future. What is the security impact of the current software-development practices, including the use of open libraries, with complex interdependencies? We\u0026rsquo;ll see how a missing check in a library included in the firmware of an industrial device may lead to full compromise of the entire manufacturing plant. What is the cybersecurity awareness level of the technical personnel who engineer, program, and operate in smart manufacturing environments? While it\u0026rsquo;s undeniable that the priorities of a perfectly functioning OT system are in contrast with the priorities of a perfectly secure IT system, one of the goals of this research was to understand exactly why this is the case, and what the cybersecurity industry can do about it.  Ep. 2: Malicious Industrial Software Extensions In this video we focus on the engineering workstation (EWS), which is a crucial endpoint used to program the logic of a smart manufacturing plant. It\u0026rsquo;s essential in any smart factory station, it should never be exposed or reachable from a public network, but we show that even if not directly reachable, an attacker can still find ways to access it.\n   In this second episode I show you how future smart factories could be infected via malicious software extensions, a new way to deliver software for industrial automation. Malicious software extensions and future industrial \u0026ldquo;app stores\u0026rdquo; represent a relevant but overlooked attack vector for smart factory environments.\nThanks to our research ABB\u0026rsquo;s RobotApps Store has fixed an upload bypass vulnerability that would have allowed anyone to upload (malicious) software extensions that could cripple into the engineering workstation, a critical endpoint used to program industrial machines such as robots.\nExtra Episode: Lateral Movements via Industrial Automation Scripts In this video we focus on two questions: What if a perfectly patched industrial manufacturing machine can still harbor for vulnerabilities where no one is looking? What if the powerful programming languages used to program these machines can go beyond simple movement instructions, and actually allow threat actors to hide malware into the logic?\n   In this unplanned, extra episode you can see the entire picture, from entry point (already glanced at in the second episode) to vulnerability exploitation and complete system compromise.\nAnd of course we conclude with an overview of the short-, medium-, and long-term remediation approaches.\nUpcoming Videos In the following videos we\u0026rsquo;ll see:\n how an attacker can access a smart manufacuring system through a trojanized IoT library, then we\u0026rsquo;ll see how a weak mobile HMI could facilitate the job of an attacker,  References  Federico Maggi, Marcello Pogliani  (2020).

So, here you go!\nShort Bio (170 words)  With more than a decade of research experience in the cybersecurity field, Federico Maggi has done offensive and defensive research on web applications, network protocols and devices, embedded systems, radio-frequency control systems, industrial robots, cars, and mobile devices.\nSome of his research work has been featured on mainstream and media outlets such as Wired, Reuters, Forbes, Hackread, ZDNet, and MIT Technology Review.\nCurrently employed as a Senior Researcher with security giant Trend Micro (https://trendmicro.com), Federico was an Assistant Professor at Politecnico di Milano, one of the leading engineering technical universities in Italy. Aside his teaching activities, Federico co-directed the security group and has managed hundreds of graduate students.\nFederico has given several lectures and talks as an invited speaker at international venues and research schools, and also serves in the review or organizing committees of well-known conferences.\nMore info about Federico and his work is available online at https://maggi.cc\n One-liner Bio (27 words)  Federico Maggi, PhD, is a Senior Researcher with Trend Micro and has been working in cybersecurity for more than a decade with the public and private sector.\n Head shot  You can also grab the high-resolution version.\nResearch Activities The mission of the team I work with is to scout the future of emerging (or legacy and widely adopted) technologies. This is easier said than done! Of course we don\u0026rsquo;t have a crystal ball. What we do is we look at a technology from a threat-actor perspective, and make an effort to \u0026ldquo;see\u0026rdquo; how things can go bad if a threat actually arise.\nThis gives us good insights on how to anticipate and prevent emerging security risks and threats. And of course this gives my employer a driver for innovation, to push new updates into existing products, or create new products. Because of this, Trend Micro\u0026rsquo;s customers will benefit from our research.\nThis is what I do most of the the time, together with my colleagues in Trend Micro Research. In addition to technology research, we constantly collaborate with law-enforcement agencies in cybercrime investigations.\nResearch Topics I Love I have been in the computer security ‚Äúcircus‚Äù since 2005.\nAlthough I enjoy doing research in really any area, looking back at my past work, it seems that my main interests revolve around various topics under the ‚Äúcyber security‚Äù and ‚Äúcyber crime‚Äù umbrella terms, such as threat analysis and intelligence, malware analysis, mobile security, fraud analysis and detection, web- and social-network security and data visualization.\nIf I have to find a distinctive aspect of my work, I like to follow data-driven or learning-based approaches. Indeed, I enjoy doing large-scale measurements.\nAn Academic Moved to the Industry World Before joining Trend Micro, until Summer 2016 I was an Assistant Professor at Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria (DEIB), Politecnico di Milano in Italy, where I co-directed the system-security group at the NECST Laboratory, and led several projects with my colleague and advisor Stefano Zanero.\nDuring my PhD, I made some contributions in the field of anomaly detection and I was using machine learning way before it became mainstream. I developed and tested various anomaly-based tools, for example to detect attacks against web applications or unexpected activities in the kernel (sing of malware infections or compromised processes).\nSpeaking: The Cherry on The Cake Let\u0026rsquo;s be honest: when the hard research work is over, isn\u0026rsquo;t it just great to get on stage and share the results with the world?\nI have given several lectures and talks, mainly peer-reviewed talks, but also as an invited speaker at international venues and research schools.\nI\u0026rsquo;m far from being a professional speaker, but people say I\u0026rsquo;m quite good at it. Have a look at some of my public speeches to get a sense of my speaking style. I used to hate and be afraid of speaking in public, and I still remember the tension and anxiety I experienced before every single talk. I don\u0026rsquo;t know exactly when and why, but something happened at some point, and everything turned upside down. Now I try to find every possible excuse to get on stage, because I find it an extremely satisfying and entertaining activity‚Äìfor myself, at least, and hopefully for the audience as well!\nHacking and Playing Around With Stuff I\u0026rsquo;m not a bug hunter, but I do occasionally find and report vulnerabilities as part of my job.\nAs my work is not focused on a particular product or vertical, I\u0026rsquo;ve never really grown a technology-specific skillset when it comes to hacking and bug hunting. Rather, I adapt and I\u0026rsquo;m eager to learn what\u0026rsquo;s needed for the next challenge. I\u0026rsquo;ve looked at web applications, desktop and mobile apps, middleware protocols, embedded protocols, and even radio frequency. So, a little bit of everything. As I mentioned at the beginning of this page, cybersecurity is the only field that managed to keep me busy with new problems.\nWhen time permits, I occasionally play CTFs or prepare challenges. Honestly, I haven\u0026rsquo;t been playing for a looong long time: I think 2004 or something, when we (early memebers of the Tower of Hanoi) played one of the very first editions of the UCSB iCTF. Thanks to @ lucacarettoni for sharing this great memory about that game. Yes, that\u0026rsquo;s the printout of the scoreboard. Amazing times!\nWith the same team, in 2015 I have led the organization of the PoliCTF contest. Was quite a lot of fun! I\u0026rsquo;m currently organizing the Capture the Signal (CTS), a contest focused exclusively on RF-hacking.\nWhen time permits, I like to pretend I\u0026rsquo;m an amateur electronic enthusiast, doing stuff like DYI automation, RF nodes, and stuff like that.\nReviewing Others' Work I\u0026rsquo;m regularly invited to serve in the review board, organizing or technical program committee of conferences. To name a few, I have been the general chair of DIMVA 2015, PC chair of EUC 2014 and PC member of several conferences and workshops including ACSAC, AsiaCCS, DIMVA, SecureComm.\n","date":1591535462,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591535462,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"/about/","publishdate":"2020-06-07T15:11:02+02:00","relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"Cybersecurity keeps giving me the best excuses to find exciting problems to solve.

I especially enjoy creating tools to extract data, analyze and explain unknown phenomena in any ICT system, at any scale.\nI am happily doing this (and more) at Trend Micro Research, where we scout the future for upcoming or overlooked security risks and threats.\n  Summary  Positions, Education and Awards  Presence in the Infosec Community  Research  Teaching and Advising Experience  References and Endorsements  For the past 17 years I have had both industrial and academic work experience, as an employee, professor, and consultant. As such, I have experience dealing with various realms, from large corporate environments, research laboratories, to small companies.\nMy work activities range from pure development to research, including both technical and dissemination tasks. In the past, I\u0026rsquo;ve done vulnerability assessment and web penetration-testing activities as a consultant, and I was hired multiple times as a technical expert witness for courts in Italy. Being member of various review boards and scientific program committees, I have extensive experience in assessing the quality of technical documents and other scientific artifacts.\nResearch Summary Although I enjoy doing research in really any area of computer science, my experience includes various topics under the ‚Äúcyber security‚Äù and ‚Äúcyber crime‚Äù umbrella terms, such as threat analysis and intelligence, malware analysis, mobile security, fraud analysis and detection, web- and social-network security, and data visualization for security.\nA distinctive aspect of my work is that I always strive to follow data-driven or learning-based approaches. The most recent example is a large-scale, data-analysis tool that I developed to find web-defacement campaigns. In agreement with the employer, I\u0026rsquo;ve partially open-sourced the tool after demoing it at Black Hat US Arsenal (2017). I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on similar projects on other topics: botnet data analysis and intelligence, mobile ransomware analysis, banking fraud intelligence, malware behavior mining, web-scale threat measurements, anomaly detection.\nResearch Dissemination and Speaking Experience I published tenths of research papers at refereed international conferences or journals, as well as technical white papers and technical blog posts. I\u0026rsquo;ve presented my work at various international venues including both academic and industrial conferences (e.g., Black Hat), as well as closed-door events.\nThanks to my extensive teaching experience, I have acquired professional proficency at speaking to and engaging with various types of audiences in both English and Italian languaeg. Thanks to these activities, I\u0026rsquo;ve grown accustomed to travel internationally and interact with a variety of cultures.\nMy work has been recognized by several research groups (UC Santa Barbara, Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas, Northeaster Univeristy, Stony Brook University, KU Leven, and Royal Holloway University of London), with which I collaborated in various occasions.\nTeamwork and Management Experience In addition to teamwork in small groups of researchers, I have been teaching computer programming, computer and network security, digital forensics, and information systems. Since 2014 I was a professor for the Computer Security course and co-teach Advanced Topics in Computer Security.\nI coordinated the organization of computer-security challenges and international competitions (CTFs). I\u0026rsquo;ve advised several PhD students. During my research projects, I am keen to involve people actively and work closely with them. During my academic career, this resulted in more than 35 theses and hundreds of people that I supervised since 2009.\nTechnical Skills R\u0026amp;D activities highly demand flexibility, and thus I\u0026rsquo;m always keen to learn a new technology. Thanks to this, I have gained hands-on experience with a wide variety of technical development and research tools, at all levels of the modern ICT stack: from a disassembler or other command-line tools, to full-fledged web-development frameworks, storage systems, as well as dev-ops or system-administration tools.\nPositions, Education and Awards Record of Employment   2016‚Äîpresent\n Title: Senior Researcher with Trend Micro, Inc.

The researchers with which I collaborate can be easily extrapolated by looking at my publication list. Therefore, I\u0026rsquo;m hereby listing the rest.\nInternational Conferences Reviewer Every year since 2008 I\u0026rsquo;ve been part of the review boards or served as an external reviewer for several conferences:\n 2021: Black Hat Europe, EuroSec, DIMVA, APWG eCrime 2020: Black Hat Europe, APWG eCrime 2019: EuroSec, DIMVA, APWG eCrime 2018: AsiaCCS, ACSAC 2017: ACSAC, DIMVA, AsiaCCS, AppSec EU, APWG eCrime, IMPS 2016: ACSAC, DIMVA 2015: DIMVA (General Chair), TRUST, MALWARE, WISTP, EUC, AppSecEU, PPREW, ESSoS. 2014: PPREW, MCSoC, TRUST, DPMPC, WISTP, IJCNN. 2013: CyCon, ICISS, 2011: EC2ND, BADGERS 2010: COMPENG 2009: EC2ND 2008: DIMVA  I was part of the Tower of Hanoi (ToH) team, with which I\u0026rsquo;ve gained experience in playing, organizing, and running CTF competitions. I\u0026rsquo;m among the organizers of the Capture the Signal (CTS), the first RF-only CTF (by Trend Micro Research)!\nReferee Service Although I\u0026rsquo;m not a strong supporter of journals in this area, in the past I have served for the following journals as a reviewer:\n International Journal of Computer Security (IJCS) International Journal of Information Security (IJIS) IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing (TDSC) ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC) Journal in Computer Virology (JCV) Computers \u0026amp; Security (CoSe)  Research My research activity revolves around a multitude of topics in the area of cyber security and e-crime, with a spin on data-analysis-oriented approaches.\nResearch Topics I focus on analysis and mitigation of current and future threats using data analysis. I\u0026rsquo;ve been using ML since the beginning of my academic career. Nowadays, there is a lot of hype around machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), and sometimes these two branches of science are brutally confused, to the point that people write ‚ÄúML/AI‚Äù or say ‚ÄúML or AI,‚Äù like they were synonyms. I prefer to take a step back, and simply say that I use data-analysis techniques, which has a much broader meaning. In particular, I do research on threat analysis and intelligence, malware analysis (including mobile malware), banking fraud analysis and detection, web and social-network security, vishing (voice phishing), and measurement. In addition, I did contributions in the field of security visualization.\nIn the past I made contributions in the field of anomaly detection: I developed and tested anomaly-based tools to mitigate Internet threats by (1) avoiding their spread via vulnerable web applications, (2) detecting unexpected activities in the operating system‚Äôs kernel (sing of malware infections or compromised processes), and (3) dealing with high number of alerts using alert correlation.\nI occasionally extend my research beyond such topics: I let new ideas grow into research projects and involve multiple research institutions as needed by the specific vertical.\nFunded Research Projects Prior to joining Trend Micro, Inc., my academic research has been supported by the following projects, in which I was either the PI or was directly involved as a researcher.\n  FACE (MIUR FIRB, 2014\u0026ndash;206) - face-project.it\n Principal Investigators: F.

Teaching and Advising Experience In 2013\u0026ndash;2017, I have been a lecturer for the Computer Security course of the 5th School of Engineering (Ingegneria dell‚ÄôInformazione) of Politecnico di Milano.\nI have been doing teaching since Master of Science (MSc), during which I\u0026rsquo;ve tutored undergraduate students in computer programming courses (Informatica 1) between 2005 and 2007. In the following list, this activity is referred to as ‚ÄúLab. Tutor‚Äù: this involves guiding students in problem-solving tasks during their programming assignment in laboratory classes. Such classes are taught by so-called ‚ÄúLab. Teaching Assistants (TAs)‚Äù. I was ‚ÄúLab. TA‚Äù between 2007 and 2010 for the same computer programming courses, which meant preparing, solving and testing computer-programming problems of increasing difficulty (mainly in ANSI C), assigning them to students, coordinating the activity of one or two Lab. Tutors, and evaluating the solutions produced by students.\nIn 2008\u0026ndash;2016 I have been TA for other courses. In particular, I thought classes in computer and network security, graduate-level courses, and prepared and graded exams for such courses. I also prepared and demonstrated practical tutorial lessons (e.g., live penetration testing exercises) to introduce young students to ethical hacking and CTFs. Also, I have been TA for non-security courses on topics such as computer system performance evaluation and information systems. For these courses I was required to teach how to solve practical exercises, prepare and grade exams, and also to prepare homework and small web application for students to request assignments, submit their solutions and automate grading.\nTaught Courses Here\u0026rsquo;s the timeline of my teaching experience:\n  2014-2015\n Instructor for Computer Security.

Sar√† cultura, sar√† mentalit√†, sar√† la scarsa alfabetizzazione digitale, sta di fatto che √® ancora guardato con sospetto da molti datori di lavoro, e con ammirazione e un pizzico di divertimento‚Äîquasi ironico (\u0026ldquo;ah ah ah, guardami lavoro dal divano!\u0026quot;)‚Äîda alcuni lavoratori. Non tutti, fortunatamente. Siamo tutti piacevolmente sorpresi da quanto velocemente molte realt√† si siano riorganizzate. üëèüëèüëè\nFondamentale √® stato il segnale forte dal Governo, che sin da subito ha consigliato‚Äîsempre pi√π caldamente‚Äîdi lavorare da casa; fino ad arrivare al DPCM firmato ieri: in soldoni, ci si pu√≤ recare sul luogo di lavoro solo se non si pu√≤ lavorare da casa. Ovviamente quel \u0026ldquo;solo se\u0026rdquo; cela un mondo di mail, messaggi, telefonate, gruppi WhatsApp tra colleghi, etc. In questi giorni ne ho viste di ogni: datori di lavoro che inviano video ai dipendenti per ricordare loro quanto sia (giustamente) importante mandare avanti il lavoro (e andare in ufficio), persone che correvano in ufficio per portarsi a casa il PC fisso, mamme esauste che inoltravano GIF animate che le ritraevano come mostri mangiafigli, insegnanti che provano in qualsiasi modo ad organizzarsi, etc.\nFatto sta che ora chi pu√≤ \u0026ldquo;deve\u0026rdquo; lavorare da casa. Io ho il privilegio di fare \u0026ldquo;smartworking\u0026rdquo; da oltre 4 anni, durante i quali ho sempre cercato di persuadere mia moglie a fare lo stesso ma, nonostante svolga un lavoro 100% di back office (le servono telefono, computer, stampante), non ha mai cambiato idea. Ora √® diventato indispensabile. Il suo datore di lavoro non la obbliga, ma le da fortunatamente il permesso. √à diventato indispensabile per noi, per mantenere i vincoli che ci siamo posti per questo periodo:\n stare a casa senza avere contatti con nessuno (salvo telematici), far vivere al meglio questa situazione ai nostri due figli di 2 e 5 anni, continuare a lavorare.  Dopo una settimana abbondante di rodaggio, il motore inizia a gira bene, quindi ecco il nostro racconto, qualche consiglio, e riferimenti.\nConsigli in breve  Separate il tempo tra lavoro e famiglia: fare due cose insieme √® frustrante per tutti. Se possibile, separate i luoghi: basta una stanza, dentro cui si lavora e basta, con la porta chiusa a chiave se serve. Se possibile, fate i turni (almeno 2 ore, idealmente 4): genitore uno lavora mentre genitore due si occupa dei figli, e viceversa. Usate bene i ritagli di tempo (s√¨, anche la \u0026ldquo;pausa pip√¨\u0026rdquo; :-) e fate una stima realistica di quanto ne avete a disposizione. La tecnologia aiuta: spesa online, cuffie, videoconferenze, chat, timer, reminder, calendari, liste, post-it. Non dimenticate un minimo di decoro: abbiamo tutti bisogno di vederci e avere contatti un po' umani, ma non a tutti piace vedere colleghi in pigiama. Usate la fantasia con i figli: dalle stupidaggini come una scatola di cartone pu√≤ nascerne un gioco di ore. Usate chiarezza e comunicate tra voi adulti, senza aspettarsi che chi lavora possa \u0026ldquo;eccezionalmente\u0026rdquo; aiutarvi mentre gestite i figli. Il tempo dei bambini √® estremamente dilatato: fate fare a loro, come vogliono loro e nel tempo che necessitano, anche 10 minuti per lavare le mani (tanto, che fretta avete?) Pianificate il giusto e preparatevi a cambiare, ma senza far predere ai vostri figli il controllo di casa.  Tempo di qualit√† Pensare di lavorare \u0026ldquo;mentre i figli fanno altro\u0026rdquo; √® impensabile. Per chi ha figli piccoli, anche solo il pensiero che uno possa rompersi il collo non fa certo lavorare tranquilli. Siamo tutti d\u0026rsquo;accordo che gli incidenti domestici sono da evitare in questo periodo, no? Se si vuole lavorare davvero, bastano anche poche ore, ma devono essere di qualit√†, ben definite, completamente a nostra disposizione. √à proprio questo il concetto di smart working, no? Stabilire cosa fare oggi, prendere coscienza del tempo a disposizione e usarlo bene. Specialmente se siete abituati ad un ufficio ben frequentato, sarete sorpresi di quanto pi√π lavoro riuscirete a fare nella stessa quantit√† di tempo.\nTurni: lavoro e gioco Pu√≤ far sorridere, ma io e mia moglie ci diamo i turni. Lei lavora al mattino mentre io mi occupo dei figli, pranziamo insieme e poi si cambia. Il pranzo lo preparo io, anche se il pi√π delle volte riscaldo gli avanzi della cena‚Äîche mia moglie fa appositamente abbondante, perch√© non dureremmo 2 giorni se dovessi cucinare io. Non lasciate che sia il caso (o peggio, i vostri figli) a scandire il tempo: parlatene tra di voi, trovate un modo che funziona bene per voi e cercate di metterlo in pratica.\nSiate da subito chiari e onesti con i vostri figli: mamma/pap√† sta lavorando, pap√†/mamma gioca con voi. Inutile dire \u0026ldquo;andiamo a salutare mamma/pap√† mentre lavora,\u0026rdquo; perch√© si aggrapperebbero a chi non possono avere in quel momento, rendendo un inferno la vita di chi li deve gestire. Tanto meglio essere chiari e farli piangere per 5' piuttosto che uno stillicidio che impedirebbe a loro di vivere con serenit√† il tempo con voi, e a chi deve lavorare di essere concentrato e lucido. Dopo qualche giorno lo impareranno. Per√≤ la regola deve essere semplice, chiara e sempre quella.\nAmmetto che i primi 2-3gg sono stati difficili. Una mia amica mi ha scritto chiedendomi come andava e dicendo che lei si divertiva un sacco a casa a lavorare con i figli. La mia risposta √® stata:\n \u0026ldquo;√® una m****a totale, tutto √® fuori controllo, come ca**o fai a divertirti?\u0026quot;\n Ma alla fine ho riflettuto: √® cos√¨, il modo migliore per combattere questa grave emergenza √® stare tutti isolati il pi√π possibile, tanto vale trovare il modo di rendere il tutto\u0026hellip;non direi \u0026ldquo;divertente\u0026rdquo; ma armonioso.\nSveglia, e al lavoro quasi come sempre Ci svegliamo come se dovessimo andare al lavoro, voglio dire con la sveglia. Mia moglie cerca di tenere gli orari di lavoro 9-13 che ha normalmente (part time). Ovviamente si √® meno \u0026ldquo;fiscali\u0026rdquo; sul tempo in modalit√† smartworking, ma la quantit√† di lavoro √® quella. Chiaramente non si smette di essere puntuali quando ci sono appuntamenti telefonici o video-chiamate.\nSulla formalit√†, per quanto possiate avere un buon rapporto con i propri colleghi, andreste mai in ufficio in pigiama o fareste una telefonata di lavoro con urla e strepiti di sottofondo?\nTrovare tempo nei ritagli di tempo Io lavoro nel pomeriggio, cercando di recuperare tempo come possibile (da contratto lavoro 8 ore): lavoro fino alle 19:30; pausa pranzo di 30'; evito distrazioni; al mattino appena sveglio leggo immediatamente le email dal cellulare. Le email che richiedono 1-2 minuti le gestisco subito prima di prepararmi, quelle \u0026ldquo;un po' pi√π lunghe\u0026rdquo; le leggo nei ritagli di 5‚Äì10' in cui i miei figli giocano autonomamente senza uccidersi a vicenda (non pensate di avere intervalli pi√π lunghi con figli di 2 e 5 anni; barare con tablet + Netflix o YouTube non vale), mentre quelle pi√π importanti le gestisco come prima cosa nel pomeriggio.\n√à pericoloso pensare di avere tempo infinito a disposizione, quindi il \u0026ldquo;lo faccio dopo nel ritaglio di tempo\u0026rdquo; non deve sfuggire di mano e non deve diventare una regola. Se serve usare qualche mezz\u0026rsquo;ora dopo aver messo a letto i figli, fatelo, ma ricordatevi che c\u0026rsquo;√® bisogno di un po' di decompressione. Non dico relax, perch√© se come noi vivete in Lombardia\u0026hellip;c\u0026rsquo;√® poco da stare allegri e rilassati.\nQuando non √® urgente, scrivilo Sembra cinico, ma \u0026ldquo;vado un secondo a dire questa cosa a mio marito/moglie/compagno/a\u0026rdquo; pu√≤ essere una pallina di neve che rotola da una cima innevata. Anche una cosa banale come \u0026ldquo;ricordiamoci che dobbiamo comprare XYZ\u0026rdquo; oppure \u0026ldquo;guarda che domani c\u0026rsquo;√® da fare quello.\u0026rdquo;\nNella nostra esperienza pu√≤ succedere di tutto:\n i figli si ricordano che esiste l\u0026rsquo;altro genitore, che avevano temporaneamente dimenticato perch√© intenti a giocare: da quel momento sar√† difficile tornare a fare quello che stavate facendo; inizia una conversazione lunga a partire da \u0026ldquo;questa cosa da un secondo\u0026rdquo;; si decide di cambiare la giornata in base alla conversazione pi√π lunga; i figli si intromettono in una questione tra adulti richiamando attenzione; si scoperchia il vaso di pandora pieno di altre \u0026ldquo;cose da un secondo\u0026rdquo; da dire/fare; \u0026hellip;  Noi preferiamo scriverci in chat se veramente √® urgente (ad es., \u0026ldquo;guarda che figlio 1 gratta sulla porta, scrostalo che non riesco a lavorare\u0026rdquo;), oppure, molto meglio, usiamo:\n lista della spesa condivisa con Todoist, ma un sistema vale l\u0026rsquo;altro purch√© permetta ad entrambi di scrivere indipendentemente sulla stessa lista senza dovervi parlare (altrimenti a che serve?); calendario condiviso che avverte quando uno aggiunge cosa al calendario, oltre ai classici reminder (usiamo Slack integrato con Google Calendar); ma anche qui, usate quello che fa per voi, purch√© sia veloce aggiungere/spostare/togliere impegni;  Generalmente ci viene abbastanza naturale rispettare il tempo dell\u0026rsquo;altro/a, che sia di lavoro o con i figli.\nSpazio di lavoro I nostri figli hanno capito molto bene che \u0026ldquo;lo studio √® un luogo di lavoro,\u0026rdquo; prima di tutto perch√© chi ci entra lavora e chiude la porta a chiave, secondo perch√© quando ci entrano loro (e sanno che non dovrebbero), glielo si dice chiaramente: \u0026ldquo;sai che non puoi entrare qui, perch√© qui si lavora.\u0026rdquo; Ovviamente in quanto bambini sono molto creativi, ed hanno imparato ad entrarci dicendo \u0026ldquo;devo lavorare,\u0026rdquo; ma si fa loro capire che non √® tempo e luogo per giocare.\nAvere una stanza dedicata, anche piccola, anche solo un angolo adibito a scrivania √® un grande vantaggio. √à ovviamente fondamentale che quella stanza diventi il \u0026ldquo;luogo di lavoro\u0026rdquo; quando √® usato come tale, quindi deve essere chiusa a chiave, altrimenti diventa immediatamente un bazar.\nSpazio e tempo di gioco Si gioca e si passa tempo con i figli nel resto della casa, che fortunatamente √® la maggior parte. Non si esce se non quando si pu√≤ stare da soli, ad esempio nel cortile privato del nostro condominio.\nDi solito passo meno tempo con i miei figli rispetto a mia moglie, ma ho imparato da lei diverse cose, che ora sono molto utili:\n coinvolgere i figli nella preparazione di pranzo, merenda, biscotti, qualsiasi cosa; se si sporcano o fanno danni, fa niente: sistemare √® comunque tempo passato con loro, tanto in quelle 4-5 ore non ho fretta di tornare a fare quello che stavo facendo; chiedere il loro aiuto anche per le piccole cose \u0026ldquo;portami questo o porta quello\u0026rdquo;; lasciarli fare.  Generalmente la nostra routine mattutina in regime normale sarebbe questa:\n ci svegliamo, accendendo le luci e metto musica nella cameretta (con Amazon Echo e un paio di interruttori \u0026ldquo;intelligenti\u0026rdquo;) sperando che si sveglino autonomamente, io e mia moglie ci prepariamo, io preparo i figli e li porto a scuola, mia moglie esce e va in ufficio, torna e li va a prendere nel pomeriggio.  Ora √® un po' cambiata:\n ci svegliamo poco prima dell\u0026rsquo;orario di lavoro, perch√© per mia moglie non c\u0026rsquo;√® tempo di commuting, ci prepariamo, i figli si svegliano da soli e nel frattempo a volte ho anche il lusso di leggere le notizie, spendo pi√π tempo possibile per fare colazione con loro, perch√© alla fine a loro piace: di norma odiano avere fretta di dover finire per andare a scuola, di norma loro finiscono colazione comunque prima di me, perch√© devo prepararla, ovviamente appena finisco vogliono giocare con me, ma io cerco di essere chiaro: voi avete fatto colazione, ora devo farla io\u0026hellip;borbottano un po' ma accettano e si trovano qualcosa da fare, li vesto e nel mentre mi chiedono \u0026ldquo;dov\u0026rsquo;√® mamma?\u0026rdquo;, e io \u0026ldquo;mamma lavora\u0026rdquo;, e loro \u0026ldquo;ma √® qui?\u0026rdquo;, e io: \u0026ldquo;s√¨, ma lavora\u0026rdquo;, \u0026hellip;, dopo qualche botta e risposta si va a convergenza e si rassegnano (ogni giorno √® meglio), ogni mattina cerco di inventarmi qualcosa di nuovo: biscotti, merenda da preparare insieme, giocare fuori, giocare in casa, costruzioni, disegni, colla, pongo, acquarelli, pastelli; anche qui il bello √® che pi√π li lascio fare pi√π il tempo passa serenamente, quando il tempo e le condizioni lo permettono li coinvolgo un po' nella preparazione del pranzo.  Tecnologia e didattica Non abbiamo figli in et√† scolare, nel senso che non devono seguire lezioni. Per questo per√≤ c\u0026rsquo;√® una guida succinta e completa alla \u0026ldquo;didattica ai tempi del Coronavirus\u0026rdquo; messa a punto da Carola Frediani che parla di:\n iniziative di supporto, piattaforme tecnologiche, consigli pratici, contenuti pronti.  A met√† tra nido e scuola dell\u0026rsquo;infanzia non si pu√≤ parlare di \u0026ldquo;didattica a distanza,\u0026rdquo; ma anche qui si pu√≤ fare qualcosa, perch√© alla fine la cosa pi√π triste per qualunque bambino √® il non poter vedere i compagni. La prima preoccupazione di mio figlio √® stata \u0026ldquo;non potr√≤ mai pi√π andare a scuola\u0026rdquo;. Quindi cerchiamo di utilizzare qualche strumento per tenere i contatti:\n stiamo organizzando delle assemblee in videoconferenza con educatrici e compagni: al primo test nessuno ha parlato, ma come inizio va bene cos√¨; ogni tanto le educatrici inviano dei video in cui leggono brevi libri \u0026ldquo;come se fossero a scuola,\u0026rdquo; mostrando le pagine in modo che i bambini che seguono possano vedere bene (attenzione: i video per i bambini possono essere \u0026ldquo;ipnotici,\u0026quot; quindi la cosa sfugge di mano velocemente e potreste ritrovarvi con le orecchie sanguinanti per aver sentito la stessa fiaba 10 volte di fila; mettete un limite).  Di questi tempi TV, YouTube, Netflix, etc., sono una valvola di sfogo oserei dire indispensabile, ma noi cerchiamo di limitarne l\u0026rsquo;utilizzo come si fa di solito, altrimenti finiremmo con figli fisicamente non stanchi, mentalmente rinco\u0026hellip;, che ogni sera andrebbero a letto sempre pi√π tardi, si sveglierebbero sempre pi√π tardi, etc. Non serve che io prosegua :-)\nRiferimenti  Guida super pratica con strumenti e trucchi per didattica a distanza: https://guerredirete.substack.com/p/guerre-di-rete-newsletter-strumenti Progetto di solidariet√† digitale con elenco aziende partecipanti: https://solidarietadigitale.agid.gov.it Bisogni psicologici dei figli: https://www.agi.it/cronaca/news/2020-03-09/coronavirus-psicologo-figli-7383905/ Non dimentichiamoci della sicurezza dei nostri dispositivi! https://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/smart-working-ecco-cosa-bisogna-sapere-tenere-sicuro-dati-ADsHL3C  ","date":1583730809,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583730809,"objectID":"f78ce29dec8e0f1fc9e5a3619a2da799","permalink":"/post/smart-working-figli-tecnologia-didattica/","publishdate":"2020-03-09T07:13:29+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/smart-working-figli-tecnologia-didattica/","section":"post","summary":"Ci voleva il termine \u0026ldquo;smart working,\u0026quot; perch√© \u0026ldquo;lavoro da casa\u0026rdquo; in Italia, per molti, proprio non va gi√π.

A successful attack, no matter how difficult the execution, can yield high-impact results that can corner an organization into giving in to cybercriminals‚Äô demands or, at the very least, cost it considerable losses.Prompted by our desire to determine how knowledgeable and imaginative attackers could be in compromising a manufacturing facility, we built the most realistic factory honeypot we had ever created. And in doing so, we also created an ideal environment where we could monitor and learn about the attacks that the honeypot came to attract. From conceptualization to actual execution, our factory honeypot was designed to be an attractive target for potential cybercriminals.Our factory honeypot took on the ruse of a small fictitious company that apparently handled clients from critical industries yet possessed inadequate security defenses. Our ruse proved successful as our honeypot saw several attacks, which we had the freedom and resources to monitor. These attacks included a malicious cryptocurrency mining campaign, two ransomware attacks, another that posed as a ransomware attack, and several scanners.In this research paper, we detail the conceptualization and creation of our most elaborate honeypot to date, and discuss the result of our monitoring and tracking of the incidents that occurred on the honeypot.","tags":null,"title":"Caught in the Act: Running a Realistic Factory Honeypot to Capture Real Threats","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"√à arrivato il momento di fare chiarezza sulle tante notizie che da circa un mese stiamo leggendo in materia di cellulari vulnerabili, sotto attacco, con buchi irreparabili, e chi pi√π ne ha pi√π ne metta.\nIn breve: niente panico.\nS√¨, alcune ricerche hanno scoperto diversi buchi di sicurezza su SIM card e cellulari Apple, ma √® importante non saltare a conclusioni sensazionalistiche: sediamoci con calma e cerchiamo di capirne di pi√π!\nParler√≤ di:\n SIMJacker e WIBJacker: lo spettro delle SIM vulnerabili, Attacchi contro gli iPhone scoperti da Google a fine agosto, Checkm8, l‚Äôottavo jailbreak exploit per dispositivi Apple.  Prima puntata: lo spettro delle SIM vulnerabili Lo scorso 12 settembre AdaptiveMobile‚Äîazienda a me sconosciuta fino a tale data, specializzata in soluzioni di protezione per utenti finali e operatori cellulari‚Äîha annunciato di aver trovato una vulnerabilit√† (soprannominata SIMJacker). Si tratta di una falla di sicurezza, in quasi tutte le SIM card esistenti. S√¨, proprio quelle inserite nel nostro smartphone. Aspetta, continua a leggere.\nAdaptiveMobile spiega di aver rilevato ripetuti attacchi che, per almeno due anni, avrebbero sfruttavano questa vulnerabilit√† ai fini di spionaggio. Spionaggio da parte di chi, e contro chi? Anche se spiegher√† al pubblico tutti i dettagli durante la conferenza internazionale Virus Bulletin 2019‚Äîche si terr√† a Londra il prossimo 3 ottobre‚ÄîAdaptiveMobile anticipa che si tratta di soggetti dotati di mezzi di intercettazione di un certo livello, e che operano in diversi paesi.\n Nota terminologica (exploit): Quando si rileva un attacco che sfrutta una specifica vulnerabilit√†, si dice che quell‚Äôattacco √® (o contiene) un exploit per quella vulnerabilit√†. Si definisce exploitation l‚Äôatto di sfruttare tale vulnerabilit√†.\n Gli attacchi in questione sarebbero stati perpetrati da enti governativi (o assimilati) contro soggetti di alto profilo, sfruttando tale vulnerabilit√† per tracciarne la posizione o per inviare comandi al telefono. Tra questi comandi di attacco c‚Äô√® anche la possibilit√† di aprire un sito web (eventualmente malevolo), senza il controllo dell‚Äôutente e senza che questo si accorga di nulla. AdaptiveMobile dice di aver rilevato, in una nazione, degli attacchi contro un centinaio di individui, oltre a picchi di attacco fino a 300 numeri di telefono tracciati in un giorno. Il tutto inviando alla vittima un ‚ÄúSMS silenzioso.‚Äù\nSoftware nelle SIM Per quanto possa sembrare ‚Äúun pezzo di plastica,‚Äù una SIM card √® un piccolissimo ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù all‚Äôinterno di un altro computer (il nostro smartphone). In quanto tale, una SIM funziona grazie al software presente nella sua memoria. Questo software √® un componente attivo, ovvero che svolge funzioni di base, che fa da tramite tra la rete dell‚Äôoperatore telefonico e il telefono. Operatore e telefono devo scambiarsi dati e comandi al fine di funzionare correttamente.\nAvete presente quelle ‚Äúapplicazioni della SIM,‚Äù che di solito non considera nessuno, e che nei vecchi cellulari erano pi√π visibili rispetto a quelli odierni, perch√© ci si trovava un‚Äôicona‚Äîda qualche parte sul telefono‚Äîcon il nome dell‚Äôoperatore? Ecco, proprio quelle. Queste applicazioni sono basate su un set di comandi che formano il cosiddetto SIM Application Toolkit (STK), che √® parte dello standard GSM. Roba vecchia, vecchissima, che si trova in varie forme nelle SIM da oltre 10 anni. Io ricordo di aver provato ad utilizzare una di queste funzionalit√† per controllare il credito.\nVulnerabilit√† non cos√¨ nuove Ma √® davvero nuova la vulnerabilit√† scoperta da AdaptiveMobile? No. √à nota dal 2013‚Äîe probabilmente anche prima. Nel 2013 infatti, SRLabs pubblica i dettagli di queste vulnerabilit√† e li presenta a Black Hat USA, una delle principali conferenze di sicurezza informatica al mondo. Se ne √® parlato anche in Italia a SMAU, nell‚Äôinverno del 2013, dalla voce di Luca Bongiorni, che da sempre si occupa di queste tematiche.\nPoco dopo l‚Äôannuncio del 12 settembre, ricercatori ben noti nella scena hanno pubblicato una certa quantit√† di dettagli tecnici su altre vulnerabilit√† analoghe a quelle rese note da AdaptiveMobile. La tecnica di exploitation si basa su degli SMS particolari, usati dall‚Äôoperatore telefonico per inviare aggiornamenti alla SIM, ad esempio per aggiungere servizi. Chiameremo WIBJacker questa seconda vulnerabilit√†.\nInsieme ai dettagli delle vulnerabilit√†, SRLabs rilascia SIMTester, uno strumento gratuito di diagnostica in grado di rivelare se una SIM presenta questo tipo di vulnerabilit√†. Dal 2014, la stessa SRLabs rilascia SnoopSnitch, un‚Äôapp per Android per monitorare il telefono su cui √® installata e rilevare tentativi di attacco, notificando l‚Äôutente in tal caso. In altre parole, dal 2014 SRLabs riceve dati da circa 500,000 telefoni, raccogliendo informazioni utilissime a misurare l‚Äôentit√† di attacchi contro le SIM.\nProprio oggi, a 2 giorni dalla conferenza Virus Bulletin 2019, quando AdaptiveMobile spiegher√† i dettagli della sua analisi, SRLabs ricorda che √® dal 2014 che sta analizzando questo fenomeno e fa chiarezza.\nQuindi quanto √® grave? Dati alla mano! Secondo i dati di SRLabs, raccolti da un campione di circa 800 SIM e 500,000 smartphone, la situazione √® stata ingigantita:\n Meno del 6% delle 800 SIM analizzate sarebbe affetta da SIMJacker, e solo il 3.5% da WIBJacker. Il 9.4% delle 800 SIM analizzate avrebbe i pre-requisiti software per essere vulnerabile a SIMJacker (ovvero, ha a bordo quel pezzo di software affetto da SIMJacker), mentre il 10.7% avrebbe i requisiti per essere vulnerabile a WIBJacker.  Quindi, anche solo guardando i pre-requisiti necessari alla presenza di una delle due vulnerabilit√†, si capisce che il fenomeno √® limitato. C‚Äô√® da notare che SRLabs ha raccolto dati sugli attacchi da un sottoinsieme non meglio specificato di 500,000 utenti. Gli operatori telefonici dovrebbero pronunciarsi, perch√© in grado di rilevare tentativi di invio di SMS di attacco, dato che hanno piena visibilit√† sulla propria rete.\nNota curiosa: Dopo queste replice, AdaptiveMobile aggiunge un aggiornamento datato 25/10/2019 (penso sia un refuso, e che volessero scrivere 25/09/2019), in cui retificano la lista di comandi invocabili attraverso \u0026ldquo;SMS silenziosi.\u0026rdquo;\nInfine, dato forse pi√π importante, sono stati rilevati attacchi contro 8 cellulari, di cui il primo nel 2016, inviati tramite 29 SMS in totale.\nSeconda puntata: gli attacchi contro gli iPhone Il 29 agosto Google Project Zero pubblica un lunghissimo blog post, molto tecnico, che spiega approfonditamente una serie di vulnerabilit√†, in iOS. Carola Frediani nel N.42 della sua newsletter (che consiglio vivamente di seguire) e Rosita Rijitano su Repubblica.it ne hanno fatto una bella ricostruzione, a cui vorrei aggiungere qualche dettaglio e approfondimento puramente nozionistico.\nSe opportunamente sfruttate, le vulnerabilit√† permettevano parziale controllo di un iPhone, ad esempio per rubarne dati quali messaggi, email, foto, eccetera. Parlo al passato, perch√© sono vulnerabilit√† gi√† gestite e risolte da Apple, che prima del 29 agosto aveva rilasciato gli opportuni aggiornamenti di sicurezza. Sarebbe infatti stato estremamente irresponsabile se Google avesse parlato pubblicamente di queste vulnerabilit√†, perch√© avrebbe fornito a chiunque i dettagli necessari, prima di segnalarle ad Apple senza dargli il tempo di risolvere il problema.\n Nota terminologica (responsible disclosure): In gergo si dice che Google ha fatto ‚Äúresponsible disclosure,‚Äù letteralmente ‚Äúdivulgazione responsabile.‚Äù √à ormai pratica comune che chi trova una vulnerabilit√† e voglia parlarne pubblicamente debba prima seguire un iter ben preciso per informare il produttore e dargli il tempo (solitamente 90 giorni) di rilasciare eventuali aggiornamenti di sicurezza a tutela dei propri utenti. Tra parentesi: √® proprio per questo che √® importante applicare gli aggiornamenti di sicurezza, mica perch√© a noi informatici piace fare le prediche! Da quel momento in avanti si potr√† parlare pubblicamente di quanto trovato. Non √® sempre Tutto cos√¨ liscio, ma prima di arrivarci vediamo come prosegue la storia.\n L‚Äôarticolo di Google Project Zero spiega che le vulnerabilit√† siano state trovate a seguito di un‚Äôindagine iniziata da alcuni attacchi, che Google stessa aveva notato tra il 2016 e il 2018.\nAttacchi da dove? Un altro team di ricerca di Google aveva notato che le pagine di alcuni siti Web (di cui non sono stati dati n√© indirizzi n√© dettagli, per ovvie ragioni) ‚Äúlanciavano‚Äù questi attacchi contro i visitatori. Significa che le pagine Web erano state preparate da chi conosceva i dettagli delle vulnerabilit√† in questione, proprio per sfruttare tali errori al fine di bypassare le misure di sicurezza di iOS, ed accedere ai dati presenti sul telefono.\nOK, ma chi erano i bersagli? Una minoranza etnica musulmana, diciamo vista poco bene dal governo cinese. Poche settimane dopo sono stati rilevati altri attacchi, basati sulle stesse vulnerabilit√†, contro una minoranza Tibetana, anch‚Äôessa considerata ‚Äúrischiosa‚Äù secondo la politica del governo cinese. Ma come si fa a sapere se un visitatore di un sito √® o non √® un bersaglio da attaccare? Esistono gli ‚Äúattacchi informatici intelligenti‚Äù? Mhh, insomma: √® un po‚Äô come dire che esistono i ‚Äúmissili intelligenti perfetti.‚Äù Difatti bastava visitare i siti in questione con un iPhone vulnerabile‚Äîossia senza gli aggiornamenti di sicurezza‚Äîper essere attaccati. Dalle informazioni a disposizione sembra che i siti ‚Äúesca‚Äù erano spesso visitati dai bersagli. Il secondo gruppo di attacchi, pur basato sulle stesse vulnerabilit√†, partiva invece da un messaggio WhatsApp inviato ai bersagli da colpire. Tramite varie tecniche di persuasione, chi perpetrava gli attacchi cercava di convincere le vittime a cliccare un link, che portava a un sito Web contenente il ‚Äúcodice di attacco.‚Äù\nAttenzione per√≤: nei periodi in cui gli attacchi furono registrati non esistevano aggiornamenti di sicurezza, perch√© le vulnerabilit√† non erano ancora state rese note ad Apple. Cosa significa?\n Nota terminologica (zero day): In gergo si dice che questi attacchi sfruttavano vulnerabilit√† ‚Äúzero day,‚Äù ovvero vulnerabilit√† ‚Äúfresche di zero giorni,‚Äù note solo a chi ne conosceva i dettagli. Ma non era stata Google a scoprirle? Quasi! I ricercatori di Google si sono accorti che qualcuno le stava gi√† usando da tempo per gli attacchi, il che implica che qualcuno le aveva gi√† scoperte e non divulgate ad Apple.\n Quando si vede una vulnerabilit√† 0-day usata in un attacco ‚Äúin the wild‚Äù, le possibilit√† sono due:\n chi le ha scoperte se le √® tenute per s√©: in tal caso si tratta quasi sicuramente dell‚Äôaggressore stesso, ossia chi ha preparato gli attacchi, oppure chi le ha scoperte le ha poi vendute pi√π o meno direttamente a chi le ha infine usate per preparare l‚Äôattacco.  Questa dinamica pu√≤ sembrare sconvolgente per chi non √® del mestiere, ma funziona proprio cos√¨: le vulnerabilit√† sono informazioni strategiche, con un valore commerciale e un mercato strutturato con diverse figure (ricercatori, venditori, intermediari, compratori), che danno a chi le possiede un chiaro vantaggio. Infatti, indipendentemente da chi le ha scoperte, nel momento stesso in cui si usa una vulnerabilit√† 0-day per preparare un attacco, la vulnerabilit√† non √® pi√π 0-day: √® bruciata, perch√© l‚Äôattacco ne √® una sua espressione. L‚Äôevidenza tecnica raccolta quando si ‚Äúregistra‚Äù un attacco contiene infatti sufficienti informazioni per risalire ai dettagli della vulnerabilit√†.\nSull‚Äôetica della compravendita e l‚Äôuso di vulnerabilit√† per fini diversi da quelli autorizzati dalla legge non mi pronuncio, altrimenti non finisco pi√π‚Äîpoi il mio fegato ne risente.\nRicapitolando Si tratta di vulnerabilit√† di un certo rilievo, a disposizione di aggressori statali o para-statali, con buone risorse finanziarie. Altro aspetto da sottolineare √® che il primo gruppo di attacchi non era perpetrato direttamente‚Äîcome il secondo‚Äîcon dei messaggi diretti alle vittime. I siti in questione erano pubblici e indicizzati da Google, per cui chiunque avrebbe potuto visitarli nel periodo in cui erano attivi. Il che significa, tra parentesi, che chi ha preparato gli attacchi ha avuto modo di ‚Äúinstallarli‚Äù sui siti in questione, perch√© ne aveva accesso.\nLa questione mi riguarda? Se stai leggendo questo articolo √® perch√© la questione certamente ti interessa. Molto probabilmente non sei tra i bersagli. Sei tra le vittime accidentali? Solo se, usando un iPhone nel periodo di esposizione (settembre 2016 e inizio 2019), hai visitato i siti in questione o hai cliccato su un link ricevuto via WhatsApp da qualcuno che, scrivendoti in inglese, cercava di convincerti a visitare un sito (ecco alcuni esempi di conversazione).\nRiprendendo un po‚Äô di concetti base spiegati nella GGAD:\n la minaccia esisteva (e probabilmente sussiste) per dei soggetti ben definiti, in questo caso due minoranze etniche in Cina; gli asset sono i dati, le comunicazioni, le foto, etc., in possesso dei soggetti appartenenti alle due minoranze etniche; la vulnerabilit√† esisteva per tutti‚Äînoi compresi‚Äîi possessori di un iPhone nel periodo tra la scoperta (in mano di pochi) e l‚Äôaggiornamento di sicurezza rilasciato da Apple la concretizzazione della minaccia √® l‚Äôuso delle vulnerabilit√† in questione per produrre uno specifico attacco.  Terza puntata: vulnerabilit√† ‚Äúirrisolvibili‚Äù in quasi tutti i dispositivi Apple Pochi giorni fa un ricercatore ha pubblicato il codice di un exploit che sfrutta una vulnerabilit√† nello strato software pi√π basso, presente nella memoria ‚Äúdi sola lettura‚Äù di tutti i dispositivi mobili. Questa memoria, detta bootrom, contiene il codice ‚Äúdi avvio,‚Äù che viene eseguito dal dispositivo all‚Äôaccensione, prima del vero e proprio sistema operativo (iOS), che invece √® lo strato software che governa gli iPhone, quello ‚Äúsopra al quale‚Äù si installano le app.\nI dispositivi Apple sono considerati ‚Äúchiusi,‚Äù perch√© la casa madre non permette di eseguire altro software al di fuori di quello da essa sviluppato (iOS) o autorizzato (app presenti nell‚ÄôApp Store). Il software contenuto nella memoria di avvio serve, tra le altre cose, per verificare l‚Äôautenticit√† del successivo ‚Äúblocco‚Äù di software da caricare, e cos√¨ via. In altre parole, se uno vuole installare una versione modificata di iOS, oppure vuole installare app senza passare dall‚ÄôApp Store, o installare app non ancora (o mai) presenti sull‚ÄôApp Store, allora dovr√† aggirare questo meccanismo di verifica. Infatti, nessun sistema operativo o app al di fuori di quanto distribuito da Apple passerebbe mai questa verifica di autenticit√†.\nDato il ruolo cardine del codice contenuto nella bootrom, questa memoria deve essere di sola lettura, ovvero non deve essere possibile scriverci sopra pi√π di una volta. Se cos√¨ fosse, allora uno potrebbe modificare le informazioni in essa contenute, alterando cos√¨ la catena di ‚Äúdipendenze crittografiche‚Äù necessarie per verificare l‚Äôautenticit√† del software da avviare. L‚Äôunico modo per modificare il contenuto della bootrom √® sostituendo la bootrom stessa, tramite un aggiornamento hardware (leggi: si sostituisce proprio il telefono).\nL‚Äôexploit appena rilasciato, denominato checkm8 (‚Äúcheckmate,‚Äù scacco), √® un ‚Äújailbreak exploit,‚Äù perch√© permette di ‚Äúuscire‚Äù dalle restrizioni sul software imposte da Apple. Si tratta di un attacco che sfrutta una vulnerabilit√† nel codice presente nella bootrom. Quindi Apple non pu√≤ farci niente? Non √® vero: Apple non pu√≤ rilasciare un aggiornamento software, ma le recenti versioni hardware non sono affette da questa vulnerabilit√†, proprio perch√© dispongono di una bootrom aggiornata. I chip in questione sono tra l‚ÄôA5 e l‚ÄôA11 compresi. Per maggiori dettagli, qui c‚Äô√® la lista di tutte le versioni delle bootrom con i relativi exploit a cui sono vulnerabili.\nPerch√© √® rilevante? Innanzitutto l‚Äôexploit funziona solo localmente, il che significa che un eventuale aggressore deve essere fisicamente in possesso del telefono. C‚Äô√® chi ha gi√† ventilato l‚Äôipotesi che, in un futuro non lontano, si riesca a sfruttare checkm8 da remoto: in quel caso, la situazione sarebbe veramente grave, perch√© basterebbe visitare ad esempio un sito, oppure ricevere un messaggio, etc. Inutile speculare: non abbiamo dettagli.\nMa allora a chi serve un exploit e una vulnerabilit√† del genere? A tre soggetti, in particolare: forze dell‚Äôordine, agenzie di intelligence e ricercatori.\n Alle forze dell‚Äôordine perch√©, dato un cellulare che si suppone contenere informazioni relative ad un caso, sar√† possibile sviluppare strumenti di recupero dati ai fini di raccolta prove. Per motivi simili, ma sotto condizioni di utilizzo diverse, le agenzie di intelligence a volte hanno bisogno di raccogliere informazioni su alcuni soggetti: con un exploit del genere si potranno sviluppare opportuni strumenti di attacco che, in pochi minuti, permetteranno di installare software spia. Ai ricercatori, perch√© come sappiamo il modello di business di Apple √® basato su un sistema chiuso, mentre la ricerca di vulnerabilit√† √® tanto pi√π facile quante pi√π informazioni si hanno a disposizione. Gi√† pochi giorni dopo dal rilascio di checkm8 sono spuntate le prime ricerche che, molto probabilmente, porteranno alla scoperta di altre vulnerabilit√†, in porzioni del software non raggiungibili con le conoscenze attuali.  Conclusioni Da questo articolo abbiamo imparato che le considerazioni da fare di fronte alla notizia di un attacco o vulnerabilit√† sono tutt‚Äôaltro che semplici: quando si legge o si sente parlare di un attacco, di una falla, √® sempre bene chiedere a qualcuno che considerate esperto a sufficienza per potervi spiegare con calma cosa significa.\nPrendetevi il tempo per leggere un articolo in pi√π, per riflettere sui 4 concetti fondamentali di cui sopra (minaccia, asset, vulnerabilit√†, attacco), senza farvi prendere dal panico. Nella maggior parte dei casi, qualcuno ha gi√† risolto il problema per voi, oppure non siete voi una vittima, quindi √® sufficiente restare informati, consapevolmente.\n","date":1569906510,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569906510,"objectID":"8d0e528d7040c2318676f06f41b980f6","permalink":"/post/al-lupo-al-lupo-tutti-gli-smartphone-non-sono-sotto-attacco/","publishdate":"2019-10-01T07:08:30+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/al-lupo-al-lupo-tutti-gli-smartphone-non-sono-sotto-attacco/","section":"post","summary":"√à arrivato il momento di fare chiarezza sulle tante notizie che da circa un mese stiamo leggendo in materia di cellulari vulnerabili, sotto attacco, con buchi irreparabili, e chi pi√π ne ha pi√π ne metta.","tags":[],"title":"Al lupo, al lupo!

Invece, dopo averlo analizzato per qualche minuto, ha trovato una vulnerabilit√† nel meccanismo di sblocco, che gli ha permesso di aprirlo in pochi secondi. In tutto questo il ricercatore non ha neanche toccato uno smartphone n√© messo mano a un computer.\nNon si tratta di una notizia: non √® il primo caso‚Äîe non sar√† nemmeno l\u0026rsquo;ultimo‚Äîma mi permette di fare una breve riflessione sull\u0026rsquo;importanza di seguire un approccio \u0026ldquo;a tutto tondo\u0026rdquo; quando pensiamo alla sicurezza: non fissiamoci su un solo punto da difendere, ma pensiamo che l\u0026rsquo;aggressore cercher√† la strada pi√π breve ed economica.\nPorta blindata per una tenda da campeggio Nel celebre libro Cryptography Engineering (disponibile anche in italiano), gli autori (Ferguson, Schneier e Kohno) ricordano che spesso ci si sofferma a progettare una porta di sicurezza di acciaio rinforzato, e gli esperti sono tutti intenti a decidere quanto debba essere spessa la lastra di acciaio. Troppo intenti per accorgersi che quella porta verr√† installata su una tenda da campeggio.\nEcco, l\u0026rsquo;esempio dello smart lock √® piuttosto in linea con questa citazione. Soffermarsi sulla parte puramente informatica della serratura‚Äîmagari anche ben fatta e piuttosto sicura, non lo so, non l\u0026rsquo;ho guardata‚Äî√® solo una delle strade. In questo caso, il lucchetto (come tanti altri), pu√≤ essere aperto con una tradizionale chiave di metallo‚Äîin caso di emergenza. Questo meccanismo di emergenza √® stato progettato male, perch√© basta praticare un piccolo foro sul lato della serratura per raggiungere con un cacciavite la leva che fa girare il cilindro che infine apre la serratura.\nAllo stesso modo: investire risorse per proteggere un computer cifrandone il disco, impostando una password robusta, mai scritta da nessuna parte, etc., tutte le partiche che ormai sono da considerarsi \u0026ldquo;di buon senso,\u0026rdquo; sono solo i primi passi. Altrettanto essenziale per√≤ √® essere consapevoli che i nostri dati pi√π preziosi magari sono su un disco di backup, magari non cifrato, oppure cifrato con la stessa password di sblocco del nostro computer, oppure con una pi√π debole, oppure il backup lo facciamo su un servizio cloud, che un giorno verr√† compromesso.\nCosa vogliamo proteggere? √à difficile, certo, ma non significa che non si debba fare nulla. Credo per√≤ che la strada corretta da percorrere non debba passare immediatamente dallo strumento, dal \u0026ldquo;programmino.\u0026rdquo; Avere fretta di \u0026ldquo;metterci una pezza\u0026rdquo; o \u0026ldquo;pagare poco o niente\u0026rdquo; √® esattamente il principio guida seguito da chi ha progettato lo smart lock di cui sopra. Avere fretta dire \u0026ldquo;ho tutti i dati sul mio disco di backup, sono al sicuro\u0026rdquo; senza fermarsi a chiedersi: dove resta questo disco? Chi vi ha accesso? Se lo perdo?\nLa strada corretta dovrebbe partire da riflessioni di questo tipo. Lo strumento e la \u0026ldquo;best practice\u0026rdquo; devono venire dopo. Gli scaffali delle librerie e il Web sono pieni zeppi di \u0026ldquo;bigini\u0026rdquo; per \u0026ldquo;farti pensare come un hacker\u0026rdquo; o guide alla sicurezza informatica che altro non sono che un\u0026rsquo;accozzaglia di parole chiave, glossari, liste di strumenti da installare, eccetera. Gli strumenti sono importanti, ma vanno governati e, soprattutto, diventano obsoleti velocemente. Consigliare solo strumenti in modo diretto √® deleterio. Spiegarne solo i principi √® sfuggente. Credo che il giusto equilibrio debba partire da una profonda riflessione sul valore che ognuno di noi vuole dare ai propri \u0026ldquo;averi digitali.\u0026rdquo; Insisto, avere consapevolezza di cosa vogliamo proteggere √® un primo, importantissimo passo.\n","date":1569301564,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600923964,"objectID":"26ba619165e4bcc7080576fec54ee25e","permalink":"/post/smart-un-lock/","publishdate":"2019-09-24T07:06:04+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/smart-un-lock/","section":"post","summary":"Un ricercatore ha forzato l\u0026rsquo;ennesimo smart lock in pochi secondi.

Questi fattori li rendono l\u0026rsquo;anello pi√π debole di un sistema di automazione. Ad esempio, se in casa abbiamo un antifurto \u0026ldquo;via radio\u0026rdquo; collegato al sistema di automazione gestito via Internet con l\u0026rsquo;immancabile app, il tutto protetto alla perfezione\u0026hellip;ovviamente un ladro punter√† sull\u0026rsquo;antifurto via radio, non sul sistema di automazione.

Da oltre 20 anni si tiene a Las Vegas, Londra e Singapore ogni anno. √à la stessa dove un paio d\u0026rsquo;anni fa abbiamo presentato la nostra ricerca sui robot industriali e dove l\u0026rsquo;anno scorso ho presentato i risultati della ricerca sulla sicurezza dei protocolli di rete IoT.\nCos\u0026rsquo;√® una vulnerabilit√†? √à un errore, una falla in un software. √à un fenomeno \u0026ldquo;naturale,\u0026rdquo; presente in qualsiasi prodotto, in questo caso software. Perch√© √® un concetto rilevante? Una vulnerabilit√†, in opportune condizioni, permette ad un aggressore di far fare al software ci√≤ che vuole. Un po' come se la serratura di casa si potesse aprire con la chiave giusta, ma anche con una graffetta fatta in un certo modo. √à quindi fondamentale, oltre a minimizzare la presenza di vulnerabilit√† a monte‚Äîovvero creando software (e serrature) ingengeristicamente di qualit√†‚Äîcontinuare la ricerca di vulnerabilit√†, al fine di permettere ai produttori di correggerle.\nUna vulnerabilit√† importante pu√≤ valere molto, e a tutti gli effetti √® venduta e scambiata in un fitto mercato con diversi intermediari. Perch√©? Immaginate di essere un\u0026rsquo;agenzia governativa di intelligence che, per vari motivi, deve poter intercettare SMS, chat e telefonate. Una vulnerabilit√† su un dispositivo mobile pu√≤ essere sfruttata per \u0026ldquo;entrare\u0026rdquo; o \u0026ldquo;mettersi in mezzo\u0026rdquo; e ascoltare. Il rovescio della medaglia √® che esiste anche un mercato sommerso, nero, dove le vulnerabilit√† sono scambiate ed acquistate da persone e organizzazioni a fini criminali, o che violano i diritti civili fondamentali (pensate ai regimi repressivi).\nIn questo caso si parla del software di dispositivi mobili (Apple e Android), quindi decisamente diffusi e \u0026ldquo;tra le mani di tutti.\u0026rdquo; Vulnerabilit√† di questo genere possono valere decine o centinaia di migliaia di Euro.\nCome possiamo essere sicuri che il nostro cellulare sia sicuro al 100% e non affetto da vulnerabilit√†? Non possiamo. √à impossibile. Toglietevelo dalla testa. Le vulnerabilit√† sono parte del processo di ingegnerizzazione e, nonostante gli ingenti investimenti dei produttori, c\u0026rsquo;√® sempre margine di errore (da un lato) e avanzamento tecnologico (dall\u0026rsquo;altro), che aprono nuove strade per vulnerabilit√† che fino a poco tempo prima erano difficili da trovare.\nMa se veramente vogliamo un telefono \u0026ldquo;il pi√π sicuro possibile?\u0026rdquo;. Questa √® gi√† una richiesta pi√π ragionevole. √à indispensabile scegliere un produttore affidabile, ossia un produttore serio, con una storia solida, che rilasci regolarmente aggiornamenti di sicurezza. √à fondamentale quindi non trascurare gli avvisi che ci chiedono di aggiornare il nostro dispositivo, perch√© non farlo pu√≤ avere conseguenze anche per chi crede di non avere nulla da temere. Perch√© se il bersaglio non siamo noi, possiamo trovarci ad essere il mezzo inconsapevole per facilitare l\u0026rsquo;attacco di un altro bersaglio.

We conducted the first-ever security analysis of this technology, which relies on proprietary radio-frequency protocols to implement remote-control functionalities. Through a two-phase evaluation approach we discovered important flaws in the design and implementation of industrial remote controllers.

In particolare io ho spiegato al pubblico da dove provengono i fiumi di video auto-generati da avidi produttori, dei contenuti pericolosi che possono celare, concludendo con qualche breve cenno alle conseguenze su sicurezza e privacy personale.\nPer trattarsi di una serata con poche pretese, sono rimasto piacevolmente sorpreso nel trovare una sala piena e attenta, mentre parlavo di un argomento che mi sta molto a cuore. Mi sono state chieste pi√π volte le slide che abbiamo usato durante la presentazione: preferisco condividere link e riferimenti bibliografici (che trovate in calce), perch√© le slide mute lasciano molto spazio all\u0026rsquo;interpretazione.\nPer chi non avesse avuto occasione di partecipare alla serata del 17 maggio, il 25 Ottobre a replicheremo a Milano ( info e registrazione). Magari mi ricorder√≤ di video-registrare la presentazione.\nDi cosa abbiamo parlato? E di cosa parleremo in autunno? Di smartphone e tablet. Questi concentrati di tecnologia sono oggetti del desiderio, in particolare per i pi√π piccoli. Secondo il pensiero di Jacques Lacan \u0026ldquo;il desiderio [\u0026hellip;] √® sempre desiderio dell\u0026rsquo;altro\u0026rdquo;. E il primo \u0026ldquo;altro\u0026rdquo; per i nostri figli siamo chiaramente noi genitori: vogliono essere (come) noi. Sin dalla nascita, i nostri figli e nipoti ci vedono con un telefono tra le mani: per lavorare, comunicare, o anche solo per rilassarci e divertirci. \u0026ldquo;Perch√© mamma, pap√†, zia, etc., maneggiano sempre questo dispositivo? Deve essere estremamente importante! Lo voglio!\u0026quot; Essi non possono ancora comprendere le nostre necessit√† professionali da un lato e il diletto personale, dall‚Äôaltro.\nCome succede alla maggior parte dei genitori‚Äîio e mia moglie in primis‚Äîarriva il giorno in cui i nostri figli scoprono le magie dello schermo: colori, forme, suoni, che possono toccare, modificare. Sempre senza capirne i motivi, da quel giorno ne hanno scoperto il piacere, il godimento che si prova nello stare a guardare questi piccoli schermi. Da quel momento cellulare e tablet sono esclusivamente una fonte inesauribile di intrattenimento, quasi ipnotico. Un‚Äôanestesia immediata e duratura, in grado di far passare tutto in secondo piano: energia, istinto, stanchezza, desideri, bisogno di giocare.\nIl risultato? Se l\u0026rsquo;accesso a questi strumenti √® totalmente fuori controllo, questo ‚Äúsucchiotto‚Äù ipermoderno crea dipendenza. Una dipendenza che non √® diversa dalla dipendenza da sostanze: a tutti gli effetti, il piacere e l\u0026rsquo;effetto ricompensa ( \u0026ldquo;tho, sei stato bravo quindi puoi guardarti un video\u0026rdquo;) che si prova nel \u0026ldquo;guardare il tablet\u0026rdquo; stimola il nostro cervello a produrre dopamina, come spiega la Prof.ssa Daniela Lucangeli, del Dipartimento di Psicologia dello sviluppo e dei processi di socializzazione dell' Universit√† degli Studi di Padova.\n  Senza entrare nel merito: pi√π si √® piccoli e pi√π rapidamente si sviluppa dipendenza da dopamina. √à per questo che se a un bambino o una bambina in questa fascia di et√† viene \u0026ldquo;tolto il tablet\u0026rdquo;, le reazioni possono essere anche molto forti.\nPerch√© siamo arrivati a questo punto? Lungi da me il voler essere l\u0026rsquo;anti-tecnologico di turno, anche perch√© non lo sono e non potrei farlo: mi occupo di informatica da quando ho ricordi, ho avuto il mio primo computer a 5 anni se non prima e passo forse 12 ore al giorno usando ben pi√π di uno schermo alla volta. La tecnologia che abbiamo oggi a disposizione offre opportunit√† fino a pochi anni fa inimmaginabili: stare in contatto \u0026ldquo;in tempo reale\u0026rdquo; con chiunque, archiviare fotografie, video, catalogare, pagare, votare, \u0026hellip;vivere! √à innegabile che tutto questo sia parte del nostro mondo, e che la distinzione tra \u0026ldquo;fisico\u0026rdquo; e \u0026ldquo;digitale\u0026rdquo; sia sempre meno definita. Noi per√≤ sappiamo che c\u0026rsquo;√® questa differenza. I nostri figli lo stanno imparando. Un videogioco non √® realt√†, ma ha impatto sulla realt√† nel momento in cui si decide di volerlo imitare facendo una rapina, picchiando i coetanei, costringendoli al suicidio o chiss√† cos\u0026rsquo;altro. Un video pubblicato su YouTube da un programma \u0026ldquo;che genera profitto\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;non √® realt√†, ma il fatto di guardarlo per ore, cliccarci sopra, etc., convertono il loro tempo la loro \u0026ldquo;attenzione\u0026rdquo; in denaro. I nostri figli guardano video e qualcuno dall\u0026rsquo;altra parte del filo si arricchisce.\nPerch√© √® rischioso? Oltre a quanto gi√† detto sopra, YouTube √® una giungla. Non tutto √® adatto agli occhi di un pubblico 0-6 anni. Durante la conferenza ho fatto l\u0026rsquo;esempio di come si pu√≤ trovare video autentici di un cartone animato, ma anche versioni modificate dello stesso cartone animato, che d\u0026rsquo;un tratto diventa estremamente violento: urla, armi, sangue. Ho visto facce inorridite dagli esempi che ho mostrato.\nA lungo termine l\u0026rsquo;effetto che si rischia di ottenere √® un aumento del \u0026ldquo;fattore fiducia\u0026rdquo; nei confronti del mezzo: \u0026ldquo;ho visto su YouTube che‚Ä¶\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;come no? L\u0026rsquo;ho visto su Facebook!\u0026rdquo; Lo facciamo ogni tanto anche noi, figuriamoci i nostri figli! Se la nostra generazione‚Äîche non √® nata con queste tecnologie‚Äî√® gi√† abbastanza vulnerabile alle sue insidie (fake news in primis), cosa immaginiamo per i nostri figli? Dopo un\u0026rsquo;infanzia \u0026ldquo;immersa\u0026rdquo; nella tecnologia, nel digitale, \u0026hellip; saranno in grado di distinguere un video autentico da uno modificato? Che opinione si formeranno dopo aver ascoltato il video di un politico che spiega i prossimi passi della sua propaganda? Sapranno scegliere consapevolmente senza farsi influenzare artificialmente?\nCosa fare? A parte i consigli scontati su cui preferisco non esprimermi, molti genitori mi hanno chiesto se ci sono alternative a YouTube. Io di solito rispondo che l\u0026rsquo;alternativa a YouTube √® \u0026ldquo;qualsiasi cosa, purch√© sia selezionata e non a libero accesso\u0026rdquo;. Se lasciamo libero accesso a YouTube4Kids ai nostri figli, non risolviamo niente. Sono comunque \u0026ldquo;suoni e immagini in movimento\u0026rdquo;, come le chiamo io.\nTolte di mezzo sporcizia e violenza in cui si pu√≤ incappare su YouTube, il punto fondamentale √® il libero accesso. Tra 0 e 6 anni non si ha consapevolezza di \u0026ldquo;quando smettere\u0026rdquo;. Detto questo, non sono nella posizione di dare consigli pratici, se non quello di far \u0026ldquo;prendere le distanze\u0026rdquo; (letteralmente!

Despite the obvious advantages in terms of production and ease of maintenance, this trend raises non-trivial cybersecurity concerns. Often, the devices employed are not designed for an interconnected world, but cannot be promptly replaced: In fact, they have essentially become legacy systems, embodying design patterns where components and networks are accounted as trusted elements. In this paper, we take a holistic view of the security issues (and challenges) that arise in designing and securely deploying controlled manufacturing systems, using industrial robots as a case study---indeed, robots are the most representative instance of a complex automatically controlled industrial device. Following up to our previous experimental analysis, we take a broad look at the deployment of industrial robots in a typical factory network and at the security challenges that arise from the interaction between operators and machines; then, we propose actionable points to secure industrial cyber-physical systems, and we discuss the limitations of the current standards in industrial robotics to account for active attackers.","tags":null,"title":"Security of controlled manufacturing systems in the connected factory: the case of industrial robots","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"After having analyzed the several RF protocols for industrial applications, distributed by global vendors, we discovered that none of them had sufficient security features to prevent an attacker from hijacking the communication and manoeuvre the controlled connected machines.\nIn Summer 2016 the condo we live in went through some renovation work. We had construction workers here for the about half a year. This was around the time when I was getting into software-defined radio (SDR) technology, and had a spectrum analyzer open all the time on my computer. Just for fun. After a while I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed some peaks of energy around 434MHz. I didn\u0026rsquo;t pay attention, until when I saw one of the workers holding what looked like a rugged remote controller with a tiny antenna. I rushed back in my office and took a closer look at the spectrum: I could clearly see that the peaks were showing in perfect sync with the noise of the huge crane swinging over my roof.\nI had a little chat with the worker and asked him: \u0026ldquo;Is there any safety mechanism? Like, if I push a button to make the load go down, and someone is under that load, what happens?\u0026rdquo; In the local dialect, he answered something that I could roughly translate as\n \u0026ldquo;ü§¨ if you do that, you must have some serious problems.\n This sounded like the perfect project idea to pitch to my colleagues! So I did. After some back and forth, brainstorming, and someone in the team having related ideas, we\u0026rsquo;ve decided to go after this, map the market, reverse engineer the protocols, look in depth into the embedded systems inside these remotes, and perform an all-around security analysis.\nSo here we are. After a long break in the middle, hard research work, and a challenging disclosure process, I\u0026rsquo;m very happy to share the results of what my colleagues in Trend Micro Research and I have produced.\nMeanwhile, the renovation work is done and we\u0026rsquo;re enjoying a shiny new stone paver.\nRadio-frequency Technology Sub-gigaherz radio-frequency (RF) protocols are widely adopted for both consumer and industrial applications. From simple garage-door openers to remote controllers that manoeuvre huge mining drillers or overhead cranes that can lift tons of loads. So, way beyond construction cranes. These RF protocols operate in the ISM bands (e.g., 433, 868, 915 MHz, depending on the region), have a range up to several hundreds meters, can easily go through obstacles, are very low priced, and are very flexible.\nIndustrial RF Remote Control Systems These industrial remote-control systems usually comprise a receiver (RX) with a few relay switches (e.g., to power up the controlled motor or other electrical loads), and a transmitter (TX) that looks like a rugged remote controller with buttons. Both RX and TX have an embedded digital radio chip and a micro-controller that implements the actual application-level protocol (e.g., structure of messages, CRCs, pairing, addressing). Each transmitted message carries a distinct command that the RX actuates, usually by triggering the relay switches in a given, configurable way.\nSecurity Angle Despite the simplicity of these systems, there is no standardization in the application-level protocol, nor security best practices that go beyond the use of rolling-code to avoid replay attacks (in the best case).\nAfter having analyzed the systems produced by several global vendors, in our research we discovered that none of the implementations had any robust security features (not even rolling codes) that would prevent an attacker from hijacking the communication and take control of the heavy industrial machines connected to the RX unit. After having responsibly disclosed our findings through Trend Micro\u0026rsquo;s ZDI ( 10 advisories and 3 ICS-CERT alerts, some of which resulted in security firmware updates), we\u0026rsquo;ve drawn a list of recommendations for end users, system integrators, and vendors, to ensure that current-generation systems get properly secured, and that next-generation systems will be secure by design.\nDetails? Nope! This has been the hard part. Digging into custom protocols and figuring out all the bits that travel on the SPI bus (to make sure that we\u0026rsquo;re looking at the right data on the RX side) was challenging, yet a lot, lot of fun!\nNo, this blog post won\u0026rsquo;t go into the details. There\u0026rsquo;s the white paper (below) for that! Plus this interactive page with demo videos, and this blog post that describes a little RF dongle we\u0026rsquo;ve built for this research.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve presented this research at Direction Tokyo last November (by the way, my first encounter with the Japanese culture was stellar!), my colleague Philippe has presented it at HITCON pacific focusing on the firmware reverse-engineering, and my colleagues Jonathan ( this Jonathan) and Stephen have just presented the white paper today at the S4 conference.\nMedia I\u0026rsquo;m not attempting to keep track of the media activity around this research, sorry!\n  „ÅÇ„Å™„Åü„ÅÆÊ©üÊ¢∞„ÄÅÂÆâÊòì„Å´„Å§„Å™„Åí„Å¶Â§ß‰∏àÂ§´Ôºü„ÄÄ„É™„Çπ„ÇØ„Å®ÊîªÊíÉÊâãÊ≥ï„ÇíÁü•„Çã, Nov 19th, 2018  „ÇØ„É¨„Éº„É≥„Çí‰∏çÊ≠£„Å´ÈÅ†ÈöîÊìç‰Ωú„ÄÅ10Âπ¥Ââç„Çà„Çä„ÄåÊîªÊíÉ„Åó„ÇÑ„Åô„ÅÑ„ÄçÔºü„ÄÄÂ∞ÇÈñÄÂÆ∂„ÅåÊ≥®ÊÑèÂñöËµ∑, Nov 29th, 2018 Scott Shuey, Gulf News, The next cyber threat won‚Äôt be over the internet, it‚Äôs on the radio ( print version).

Cranes, drills, and miners, among others, are commonly equipped with RF remotes. Unfortunately, these devices have become the weakest link in these safety-critical applications, characterized by long life spans, high replacement costs, and cumbersome patching processes. Given the pervasive connectivity promoted by the Industry 4.0 trend, we foresee a security risk in this domain as has happened in other fields.  Our research reveals that RF remote controllers are distributed globally, and millions of vulnerable units are installed on heavy industrial machinery and environments. Our extensive in-lab and on-site analysis of devices made by seven popular vendors reveals a lack of security features at different levels, with obscure, proprietary protocols instead of standard ones. They are vulnerable to command spoofing, so an attacker can selectively alter their behavior by crafting arbitrary commands ‚Äî with consequences ranging from theft and extortion to sabotage and injury.  This research analyzes and shows how an attacker can persistently and remotely take control or simulate the malfunction of the attached machinery, through attacks like command injection, emergency-stop (e-stop) abuse, and malicious re-pairing. In addition, many modern radio controllers can be programmed via software, which also lacks any security measures, opening them to remote attack vectors. A remote attacker who compromises the computer used to program these remotes can alter their firmware to implement persistent and sophisticated attacks.  Having examined the root cause of the vulnerabilities that make these attacks possible, we have reached out to the affected vendors to promote suitable mitigation, and we hope that our research will help raise awareness and avoid unfortunate situations regarding RF remote controllers in industrial applications.","tags":null,"title":"A Security Analysis of Radio Remote Controllers for Industrial Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi","Davide Quarta"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1544054400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591348035,"objectID":"d5aad251bb3d9dae230c85d0ad63c584","permalink":"/talk/maggi_mqttbheu_talk_2018/","publishdate":"2018-12-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/maggi_mqttbheu_talk_2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Two popular machine-to-machine (M2M) protocols‚ÄîMQTT \u0026 CoAP‚Äîare slowly forming the backbone of many IoT infrastructures, including critical industry environments.

Using MQTT \u0026 CoAP as a concrete example of modern M2M technology, we will provide recommendations at various levels (standardization bodies, vendors, developers, and users) in the hope to see a significant reduction in the number of insecure deployments in the future, and a more responsible position by standardization bodies.","tags":null,"title":"When Machines Can't Talk: Security and Privacy Issues of Machine-to-Machine Data Protocols","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi","Rainer Vosseler","Davide Quarta"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1543881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591348204,"objectID":"ae8bdbf534857200db8fd2e286c069c1","permalink":"/publication/maggi_mqttwp_tr_2018/","publishdate":"2018-12-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maggi_mqttwp_tr_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"The most popular protocols for machine-tomachine (M2M) technology---the backbone of the internet of things (IoT) and industrial internet of things (IIoT)---are affected by security and privacy issues that impact several market verticals, applications, products, and brands.

While investigating several campaigns, we observed that the artifacts left by these attackers allow an expert analyst to investigate their modus operandi and social structure, and expand from single attacks to a group of related incidents. However, manually performing such analysis on millions of events is tedious, and poses scalability challenges.  From these observations, we conceived an automated system that efficiently builds intelligence information out of raw events. Our approach streamlines the analysts job by automatically recognizing web campaigns, and assigning meaningful textual labels to them. Applied to a comprehensive dataset of 13 million incidents, our approach allowed us to conduct what we believe been the first large-scale investigation of this form. In addition, our approach is meant to be adopted operationally by analysts to identify live campaigns in the real world.  We analyze the social structure of modern web attackers, which includes lone individuals as well as actors that cooperate in teams.

DefPloreX is pretty flexible and, in principle, it could be used to process any web page, for instance those planted as a result of an attack, or to \u0026ldquo;cluster\u0026rdquo; together web pages of underground web sites, and any other e-crime forensics task that requires to \u0026ldquo;make sense\u0026rdquo; out of a large dataset of web pages.\nDefPloreX ingests plain and flat tabular files (e.g., CSV files) containing metadata records of web incidents under analysis (e.g., URLs), renders them and obtains a copy of their resources with headless browsers (we tried basically all of them, but then we settled with Chrome via Puppeteer), extracts numerical features, and stores the resulting data to an Elastic index. We\u0026rsquo;ve designed any task to be distributed by default, using Celery to coordinate them.\nOn top of the Elastic back-end, I\u0026rsquo;ve cooked up a ReactJS-based web-app (which as of now is not part of the open-source release, mainly because the code is very messy) to interactively explore, query, and dig into the data. This allows an analyst to easily investigate on campaigns, for example in discovering websites targeted by the same campaign or attributing one or more actors to the same hacking group. All of this without sacrificing the interactivity aspect of the investigation.\nIf you want to see the web app in action, you can take yourself a 14 minutes coffee or tea break while watching this demo.\n  Distributed Data Processing Normally, to take full advantage of Elastic\u0026rsquo;s distributed data-processing functionality, you need to resort to scripting.\nAlthough scripting is quite powerful and handy for small data-manipulation tasks, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit cumbersome to deploy and handle requires; and, in addition, it requires full access to the Elastic\u0026rsquo;s client nodes. For example, if you need to process all the documents in an Elastic index (e.g., to enrich them by computing additional fields), you will have to choose one of the scripting languages supported by Elastic, write a script, deploy it and run it. Needless to say, your script will run within the context of the ES runtime, with all the limitations that this implies. For example, should you need to use Python, you\u0026rsquo;re forced to use the Jython Java implementation of Python, which is not the same as pure Python. For instance, some of the libraries that you may want to use may not be supported, and so on. In other words, we don\u0026rsquo;t want to depend on the Elastic\u0026rsquo;s scripting subsystem in our work :-)\nInstead, we take a more \u0026ldquo;detached\u0026rdquo; approach. We decouple the data-processing part, making it independent from the Elastic runtime and architecture, and rely on ES exclusively as a data back-end to store, retrieve and modify JSON documents. The coordination of the distributed computation is delegated to a well-known and widely used distributed task queue: Celery. The friendliness of Celery is astonishing: from the programmer\u0026rsquo;s perspective, all it requires is to write your data-processing code by means of a function, and Celery will take care of offloading the (expensive and long-running) computation to one of the available workers.\nFor example, if you need to visit a web page with an automated headless browser, all you need to do is to wrap your code into a function, let\u0026rsquo;s say visit_page, and decorate it with @app.task to inform Celery that this is a task:\n@app.task def visit_page(url): result = long_running_process(url) return result  Later on in your code, all you need to do is to call the function (almost) as you would normally do:\nvisit_page.delay(url)  The .delay() function indicates that the function call will not execute immediately, but instead will be \u0026ldquo;pushed\u0026rdquo; into a task list, from which an available worker will pull it and do the work.\nOn the other end of the task list, you can launch as many workers as you need, by simply keeping the Celery daemon active:\n$ celery worker --autoscale=6,64  Assuming a 64-core machine, this command spawns 6 concurrent processes, up to 64 when more workload comes in. And of course you can add as many workers as needed, from a single computer with a few tenths of cores, to a full rack distributed across the globe. In our deployment, we have 5 machines, with a total of 128 cores. With these modest resources, we were able to visit the entire collection of over 13 million web pages in a week. Adding more cores would have made the analysis even faster.\nDocument Transformations From this moment on, we have a solid foundation to efficiently transform JSON documents stored in the Elastic index. Therefore, we \u0026ldquo;encode\u0026rdquo; any operation that we need to perform in DefPloreX by means of a few lines of Python code. For example, we often need to \u0026ldquo;tag\u0026rdquo; JSON documents to mark those that have been processed. To this end, as exemplified in this repository, we use the TagTransformer transformation. As any other transform, this function receives one JSON document and returns the newly added fields, or the modified fields.\nclass TagTransformer(Transformer): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; Example transform to append tag to a record. \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; _name = 'tag' # unique name def __call__(self, doc, *args, **kwargs): doc = super(TagTransformer, self).__call__( doc, *args, **kwargs) tag = kwargs.get('tag') # tag that we want to apply to the JSON if not tag: log.debug('No tags supplied, skipping') return [] tags = doc.get('tags', []) # get the 'tags' field from the existing JSON doc if tags: log.debug('Found tags: %s', tags) tags.append(tag) # append the new tag tags = list(set(tags)) # remove duplicates log.debug('Updated tags: %s', tags) return dict(tags=tags) # return the enriched JSON  The output of this transformation is automatically handled by our Elastic wrapper (see backend.elastic.ESStorer) and the transformer.Pipeline class, which merges the new (partial) document with the original one and saves it into the ES index. Actually, this is performed in bulk: that is, every worker consumes and processes a given amount of documents at each round (default is 1000). To summarize: given a query, we enqueue all the IDs of the documents that match that query. The queue consumers will pull 1000 IDs at a time, query Elastic for the respective documents, transform them, and push them back on Elastic as update operations.\nOther transformations that we have implemented (briefly explained in the following) include for example visiting the web pages with an automated, headless browser, extracting information from the visited web pages, calculating numerical features, and so on. Every task is expressed by means of a subclass of Transformer, which takes as input a document, and returns the enriched or modified fields.\nThe White Paper With the help of our great colleagues at TrendLabs, we prepared a white paper that focuses on the major campaigns, and how DefPloreX helped explore them. In particular, we look at 7 campaigns that have affected Israel, France, India, Syria, Kosovo, and countries surrounding the South China Sea. We dig into specific conflicts in those areas and the defacements that happened in the aftermath.\nTo feed our curiosity and~ help CERTs understand better the origin of these attacks and modus-operandi of the groups, we also look how they are organized (some are formed across continents, and some are a loose collection of local hackers), as well as how their recruitment tools and the methods adopt.\nThe Devil Answer is in the Details You might be wondering how exactly the data-mining workflow works, what features we use, what clustering algorithm and so on. For the impatient, here\u0026rsquo;s a quick overview of the data that we process and the features that we extract:\nSo, now, how do we use these features for clustering?\nI\u0026rsquo;m very thankful to Roberto Perdisci for the valuable insights that he provided on this work about the machine-learning and data-mining part. What I\u0026rsquo;m most thankful about, however, is the suggestion to use BIRCH, which I didn\u0026rsquo;t know before. I think this figure speaks by itself.\nImpressive, huh?\nReferences   Federico Maggi, Marco Balduzzi, Ryan Flores, Lion Gu, Vincenzo Ciancaglini  (2018).

The altered pages, calleddeface pages, can negatively affect the reputation and business of the victim site. Previous research has focused primarily on detection, rather than exploring the defacement phenomenon in depth. While investigating several defacements, we observed that the artifacts left by the defacers allow an expert analyst to investigate the actors' modus operandi and social structure, and expand from the single deface page to a group of related defacements (i.e., acampaign ). However, manually performing such analysis on millions of incidents is tedious, and poses scalability challenges. From these observations, we propose an automated approach that efficiently builds intelligence information out of raw deface pages. Our approach streamlines the analysts job by automatically recognizing defacement campaigns, and assigning meaningful textual labels to them. Applied to a comprehensive dataset of 13 million defacement records, from Jan. 1998 to Sept. 2016, our approach allowed us to conduct the first large-scale measurement on web defacement campaigns. In addition, our approach is meant to be adopted operationally by analysts to identify live campaigns on the field.  We go beyond confirming anecdotal evidence. We analyze the social structure of modern defacers, which includes lone individuals as well as actors that cooperate with each others, or with teams, which evolve over time and dominate the scene. We conclude by drawing a parallel between the time line of World-shaping events and defacement campaigns, representing the evolution of the interests and orientation of modern defacers.","tags":null,"title":"Investigating Web Defacement Campaigns at Large","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1523232000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591348035,"objectID":"f96def18dab1e2dc1b927d76c660566d","permalink":"/talk/maggi_iiothmi_talk_2018/","publishdate":"2018-04-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/maggi_iiothmi_talk_2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Despite the focus on future-generation equipment, legacy industrial machines will continue to exist.

Besides the software vulnerabilities that we have found, which we consider \"natural\" in embedded software, we focused on the root cause of these vulnerabilities and we will discuss our thoughts and practical recommendations with the audience. We will provide a demo of what happens when an attacker compromises an industrial robot, explaining how a software flaw can go all the way down to affecting the quality of the manufactured goods.

The research community has put considerable effort into investigating these incidents but has mostly focused on detecting attacks and not delving into the reasons behind these attacks.  Of course, the typical cybercriminal's goal is to profit. They might compromise websites to push ransomware, or they could try and steal data‚Äîrecent breaches show that information is an increasingly valuable commodity. But, as this paper discusses, more emotional motivations, such as patriotism, specific real-world events or simply hacktivism, can also trigger compromises.  Web defacement hacktivism is the practice of subverting a website with the goal of promoting a specific agenda or political ideology. Methods may vary, but when hacktivists compromise a website, the usual tactic involves replacing the original page with their version‚Äîa practice that is called web defacement. Hacktivism is mainly linked to web defacement, but a hacktivist (the attacker) can also be involved in traffic redirection (from a legitimate site to an attackerowned site), denial of service (a form of service disruption), and malware distribution to support their particular cause.  Dedicated websites like Zone-H1 collect evidence of web defacements and defacers can voluntarily advertise their compromise by submitting a report. Elaborating on the reasons behind web defacements at scale is not as easy as it seems. While someone could theorize that geopolitical events and conflicts influence cybercriminals‚Äô attacks against websites and their choice of victims, corroborating this phenomenon requires large-scale analysis.  Our examination of over 13 million web defacement reports against websites spans over 18 years, covering multiple continents. We designed an internal system that gathers, analyzes, and clusters these millions of reports. As we identify the major campaigns of these defacers, we can provide further insights into how geopolitical events are reflected in web defacements. We also look at how different factors, such as the political beliefs and the defacers' religious inclination, can trigger and affect these attacks.  Our first two sections provide high-level insights into our dataset of defacements, as well as some defining facts about the targets and tactics used by the defacers. Our next section on Real World Impact breaks down seven top campaigns that have affected Israel, France, India, Syria, Kosovo, and countries surrounding the South China Sea. We delve into specific conflicts in those areas and the defacements that happened in the aftermath.  The succeeding sections cover the hacking groups' affiliations and how their collectives are organized‚Äîsome collectives are formed across continents, and some are a loose collection of local hackers. Recruitment tools and the methods used to distribute hacking techniques are also discussed.  The final sections discuss other activities that defacers take part in, and how the current activities may evolve. Recently, there have been incidents of hackers who have gone from simple web defacement to activities supporting cybercrime. There is a real possibility that defacers and defacement groups will start to escalate their activities, move away from ideological motivations, and turn into cybercrime.

In this paper, we describe how autonomous crawlers can be abused by attackers to exploit vulnerabilities on thirdparty websites while hiding the true origin of the attacks. Moreover, we show how certain vulnerabilities on websites that are currently deemed unimportant, can be abused in a way that would allow an attacker to arbitrarily boost the rankings of malicious websites in the search results of popular search engines.

To validate our hypothesis, we propose a semi-automated approach to find recurring vulnerabilities starting from a handful of top-ranked tutorials that contain vulnerable code snippets. We evaluate our approach by performing an analysis of tens of thousands of open-source web applications to check if vulnerabilities originating in the selected tutorials recur. Our analysis framework has been running on a standard PC, analyzed 64,415 PHP codebases hosted on GitHub thus far, and found a total of 117 vulnerabilities that have a strong syntactic similarity to vulnerable code snippets present in popular tutorials. In addition to shedding light on the anecdotal belief that programmers reuse web tutorial code in an ad hoc manner, our study finds disconcerting evidence of insufficiently reviewed tutorials compromising the security of open-source projects.

These vulnerabilities usually manifest as memory access violations caused by tainted program input. Although fuzzers have helped uncover a majority of taint-style vulnerabilities in software to date, they are limited by (i) extent of test coverage; and (ii) the availability of fuzzable test cases. Therefore, fuzzing alone cannot provide a high assurance that all taint-style vulnerabilities have been uncovered.  In this paper, we use static template matching to find recurrences of fuzzer-discovered vulnerabilities. To compensate for the inherent incompleteness of template matching, we implement a simple yet effective match-ranking algorithm that uses test coverage data to focus attention on matches comprising untested code. We prototype our approach using the Clang/LLVM compiler toolchain and use it in conjunction with afl-fuzz, a modern coverage-guided fuzzer. Using a case study carried out on the Open vSwitch codebase, we show that our prototype uncovers corner cases in modules that lack a fuzzable test harness. Our work demonstrates that static analysis can effectively complement fuzz testing, and is a useful addition to the security assessment tool-set. Furthermore, our techniques hold promise for increasing the effectiveness of program analysis and testing, and serve as a building block for a hybrid vulnerability discovery framework.","tags":["workshop"],"title":"Static Exploration of Taint-Style Vulnerabilities Found by Fuzzing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Davide Quarta","Marcello Pogliani","Mario Polino","Federico Maggi","Zanero Stefano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1501113600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591348035,"objectID":"3181c9b7601c6122808cda71bf929a44","permalink":"/talk/quarta_robosecbhus_talk_2017/","publishdate":"2017-07-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/quarta_robosecbhus_talk_2017/","section":"talk","summary":"Industrial robots are complex cyber-physical systems used for manufacturing, and a critical component of any modern factory. These robots aren't just electromechanical devices but include complex embedded controllers, which are often interconnected with other computers in the factory network, safety systems, and to the Internet for remote monitoring and maintenance. In this scenario, industrial routers also play a key role, because they directly expose the robot's controller. Therefore, the impact of a single, simple vulnerability can grant attackers an easy entry point.  Industrial robots must follow three fundamental laws: accurately \"read\" from the physical world through sensors and \"write\" (i.e. perform actions) through actuators, refuse to execute self-damaging control logic, and most importantly, echoing Asimov, never harm humans. By combining a set of vulnerabilities we discovered on a real robot, we will demonstrate how remote attackers are able to violate such fundamental laws up to the point where they can alter the manufactured product, physically damage the robot, steal industry secrets, or injure humans.  We will cover in-depth technical aspects (e.g., reverse engineering and vulnerability details, and attack PoCs), alongside a broader discussion on the security posture of industrial routers and robots: Why these devices are attractive for attackers? What could they achieve? Are they hard to compromise?

Researchers are not different! A sort of common feeling is that the more data someone collects, the more self-confident he becomes about, say, a threat or another phenomenon. However, large volumes of data imply more processing resources needed, especially in extracting meaningful and useful information if the data is highly unstructured. As a result, manual data analysis is often the only choice, with security professionals like pen-testers, reversers and analysts processing data through tedious repetitive operations.  Given this situation, and our research lab suffering from similar problems, we have spent the first half of 2017 implementing a flexible toolkit based on open-source libraries for efficiently analyzing millions of deface pages and web incidents. Our tool, DefPloreX, uses a combination of machine-learning and visualization techniques to practically turn original unstructured data into meaningful high-level descriptions. Real-time information on incidents, breaches, attacks and vulnerabilities, for example, are efficiently processed and condensed into objects that are easily browsable -- making them suitable for efficient large-scale eCrime forensics and investigations.  DefPloreX ingests plain CSV inputs about web incidents to analyze, explores their resources with headless browsers, extracts features from deface pages, and uploads the resulting data to an Elastic index. Distributed headless browsers are coordinated via Celery. Using Python Panda, NumPy and PyTables, DefPloreX provides offline \"views\" of the data, allowing easy pivoting and exploration. Our toolkit automatically groups similar deface pages in clusters and organizes web incidents in campaigns. Requiring only one pass, clustering is intrinsically parallel and not memory bound. DefPloreX offers text- and web-based UIs, which can be queried using a simple language for investigations and forensics.","tags":null,"title":"DefPloreX: A Machine Learning Toolkit for Large-scale e-Crime Forensics","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Andrea Continella","Alessandro Guagnelli","Giovanni Zingaro","Giulio De Pasquale","Alessandro Barenghi","Stefano Zanero","Federico Maggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1501113600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591348035,"objectID":"e429e4e87d1315f2f117522e10a48cc1","permalink":"/talk/continella_shieldfsbhus_talk_2017/","publishdate":"2017-07-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/continella_shieldfsbhus_talk_2017/","section":"talk","summary":"Preventive and reactive security measures can only partially mitigate the damage caused by modern ransomware attacks. The remarkable amount of illicit profit and the cybercriminals' increasing interest in ransomware schemes demonstrate that current defense solutions are failing, and a large number of users are actually paying the ransoms. In fact, pure-detection approaches (e.g., based on analysis sandboxes or pipelines) are not sufficient, because, when luck allows a sample to be isolated and analyzed, it is already too late for several users! Moreover, modern ransomware implements several techniques to prevent detection by common AV. Similarly, for performance reasons, backups leave a small-but-important window of recent files unprotected.  We believe that a forward-looking solution is to equip modern operating systems with generic, practical self-healing capabilities against this serious threat.  In this talk, we will present ShieldFS, a drop-in driver that makes the Windows native filesystem immune to ransomware attacks, even when detection fails ShieldFS dynamically toggles a protection layer that acts as a copy-on-write mechanism whenever its detection component reveals suspicious activity. For this, ShieldFS monitors the filesystem's internals to update a set of adaptive models that profile the system activity over time. This detection is based on a study of the filesystem activity of over 2,245 applications, and takes into account the entropy of write operations, frequency of read, write, and folder-listing operations, fraction of files renamed, and the file-type usage statistics. Additionally, ShieldFS monitors the memory pages of each \"potentially malicious\" process, searching for traces of the typical block cipher key schedules.  We will show how ShieldFS can shadow the write operations. Whenever one or more processes violate our detection component, their operations are deemed malicious and the side effects on the filesystem are transparently rolled back.  Last, we will demo how effective ShieldFS is against samples from state of the art ransomware families, showing that it is able to detect the malicious activity at runtime and transparently recover all the original files.","tags":null,"title":"ShieldFS: The Last Word in Ransomware-resilient File Systems","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Andrea Palanca","Eric Evenchick","Federico Maggi","Stefano Zanero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1499299200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591345282,"objectID":"5b084ebcb106f56d564967c5d2511e24","permalink":"/publication/palanca_candos_2017/","publishdate":"2017-07-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/palanca_candos_2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Modern vehicles incorporate tens of electronic control units (ECUs), driven by as much as 100,000,000 lines of code.

In this paper we propose Prometheus, an automatic system that is able to analyze trojans that base their attack technique on DOM modifications. Prometheus is able to identify the injection operations performed by malware, and generate signatures based on the injection behavior. Furthermore, it is able to extract the WebInject targets by using memory forensic techniques.

For the first time, with this research‚Äîa collaboration between Politecnico di Milano (POLIMI) and the Trend Micro Forward-Looking Threat Research (FTR) Team‚Äîwe have been able to analyze the impact of system-specific attacks and demonstrate attack scenarios on actual standard industrial robots in a controlled environment. In industrial devices, the impact of a single, simple software vulnerability can already have serious consequences. Depending on the actual setup and security posture of the targeted smart factory, attackers could trigger attacks that could amount to massive financial damage to the company in question or at worst, even affect critical goods. Almost all industry sectors that are critical for a nation are potentially at risk.  Unfortunately, the Industry 4.0 revolution is just bringing industrial robots closer to the forefront. As improvements in the way industrial robots work and communicate increase their complexity and interconnectedness, the industrial robots sector unlocks a broader attack surface. In our security analysis, we found that the software running on these devices is outdated; based on vulnerable OSs and libraries, sometimes relying on obsolete or cryptographic libraries; and have weak authentication systems with default, unchangeable credentials. Additionally, the Trend Micro FTR Team found tens of thousands of industrial devices residing on public IP addresses, which could include exposed industrial robots, further increasing the risk that an attacker can access and hack them.  The impact of vulnerabilities, for example on robots, is what makes our findings a very loud wake-up call for the industrial control systems (ICS) sector. To quantify such impact, our security analysis revealed that industrial robots must follow three fundamental laws‚Äîaccurately ‚Äúread‚Äù from the physical world through sensors and ‚Äúwrite‚Äù (i.e., perform actions) through motors and tools, refuse to execute self-damaging control logic, and most importantly, echo one of the ‚ÄúLaws of Robotics‚Äù (devised by Isaac Asimov, a popular science writer) to never harm humans. Then, by combining the set of vulnerabilities that we discovered on a real, standard robot installed in our laboratory, we demonstrated how remote attackers can violate such fundamental laws up to the point where they can alter or introduce minor defects in the manufactured product, physically damage the robot, steal industry secrets, or injure humans. We then considered some threat scenarios on how attackers capitalized on these attacks, as in an act of sabotage or a ransomware-like scheme.  On the one hand, industrial devices are designed according to strict physical security and safety standards in order to work in rough conditions with extreme temperature ranges, vibrations, and electromagnetic noise. On the other, because of the ubiquity and flexibility demanded by the Industry 4.0 trend, industrial devices are being designed to be flexible, easy to deploy, and to not necessarily require any special security or IT skills. These opposing design requirements make producers very prone to introducing software bugs.  Rather than concluding this paper with a classic checklist for ICS vendors, we reflected on reasons why the situation has not changed much over the years. Thus, we provided a series of research and engineering challenges that we believe will make a difference in the journey to secure the Industry 4.0 ecosystem. On this journey toward improving the security posture of robots in the Industry 4.0 setting, we also began reaching out to vendors, among whom ABB Robotics stood out in that it readily welcomed suggestions we had to offer and even started working on a response plan that will affect its current product line without losing time.","tags":null,"title":"Rogue Robots: Testing the Limits of an Industrial Robot‚Äôs Security","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vasilios Mavroudis","Shuang Hao","Yanick Fratantonio","Federico Maggi","Christopher Kruegel","Giovanni Vigna"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1491264000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591345282,"objectID":"ebfb6c7fa82c5012294b44e36e23578e","permalink":"/publication/mavroudis_ubeacsec_2017/","publishdate":"2017-04-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mavroudis_ubeacsec_2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Nowadays users often possess a variety of electronic devices for communication and entertainment. In particular, smartphones are playing an increasingly central role in users‚Äô lives: Users carry them everywhere they go and often use them to control other devices. This trend provides incentives for the industry to tackle new challenges, such as cross-device authentication, and to develop new monetization schemes. A new technology based on ultrasounds has recently emerged to meet these demands. Ultrasound technology has a number of desirable features: it is easy to deploy, flexible, and inaudible by humans. This technology is already utilized in a number of different real-world applications, such as device pairing, proximity detection, and cross-device tracking.  This paper examines the different facets of ultrasound-based technology. Initially, we discuss how it is already used in the real world, and subsequently examine this emerging technology from the privacy and security perspectives. In particular, we first observe that the lack of OS features results in violations of the principle of least privilege: an app that wants to use this technology currently needs to require full access to the device microphone. We then analyse real-world Android apps and find that tracking techniques based on ultrasounds suffer from a number of vulnerabilities and are susceptible to various attacks. For example, we show that ultrasound cross-device tracking deployments can be abused to perform stealthy deanonymization attacks (e.g., to unmask users who browse the Internet through anonymity networks such as Tor), to inject fake or spoofed audio beacons, and to leak a user‚Äôs private information.  Based on our findings, we introduce several defense mechanisms. We first propose and implement immediately deployable defenses that empower practitioners, researchers, and everyday users to protect their privacy. In particular, we introduce a browser extension and an Android permission that enable the user to selectively suppress frequencies falling within the ultrasonic spectrum. We then argue for the standardization of ultrasound beacons, and we envision a flexible OS-level API that addresses both the effortless deployment of ultrasound-enabled applications, and the prevention of existing privacy and security problems.","tags":null,"title":"On the Privacy and Security of the Ultrasound Ecosystem","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"The day before the EyePyramid case exploded, I received a confidential email with a PDF.

At some point, I received a non-redacted copy.\nIt seems that your browser cannot display the PDF file; Please use this link  instead. Thanks!   I typically do not work on e-crime investigation cases, but while reading the court order I felt that something was not completely right. Moreover, the case was in Italy, my home country, which motivated me to look at it. Then, some colleagues from Trend Micro Italy contacted me with questions coming from our clients (for which, back then, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t answer yet). So, at the end of the day I decided to dive in!\nPuzzling Facts in the Court Order I skimmed through the court order and was surprised by the vast amount of technical evidence provided to support the accusations. Email addresses (in clear or easy to guess when redacted), IP addresses, domain names. So detailed that I could basically write a Yara rule to hunt for malware samples, without even looking at a single binary.\nAnd then, the part that puzzled me most. The author of the malware used a licensed software library and allegedly purchased the license under the name of Giulio Occhionero (one of the two brothers). It\u0026rsquo;s like, leaving your name on the crime scene!\n(Almost) Live Reversing After getting my hands on some samples (yes, with Yara hunting rules based on the court order), things escalated quickly, and found myself looking at nearly 250 samples. With the help of my fine colleagues, we\u0026rsquo;ve drawn rough, big picture of the whole scheme and started to find confirmatory evidence.\nIn a few hours, people on Twitter and other social networks started to follow the case closely, comment on it, give their own views. Given some confusion, I felt the urge to publish a list of \u0026ldquo;cold, simple, yet true\u0026rdquo; technical facts. So I\u0026rsquo;ve spun up a GitHub Gist (now deleted), which then evolved in a full repository (now not updated anymore), and finally a post on Medium (in Italian). Results were popping up rapidly, so I found myself unable to keep up with the pace, and decided to stop \u0026ldquo;live reversing\u0026rdquo; the samples, set aside some time and prepare two comprehensive posts for TrendLab\u0026rsquo;s Intelligence Blog, which my employer was very happy to release in no time.\n Jan 18, 2017 - Uncovering the Inner Workings of EyePyramid Jan 11, 2017 - The Eye of the Storm: A Look at EyePyramid, the Malware Supposedly Used in High-Profile Hacks in Italy  Summary of the Case On the one hand, the original source code had gone through only very mild modifications (e.g., not all variants are able to exfiltrate Skype conversations, C\u0026amp;C and dropzones, compiler version, and protection mechanisms). On the other hand, the computer(s) used to build the various versions over the years seemed to be in line with the evolution of Microsoft developer tools (based on the progression of the compiler version) and software-protection tools (as seen on the recent substitution of Skater plus Dotfuscator with the more powerful ConfuserEx). This indicates that the actors behind this operation knew what they were doing. Of course, this was (and still) far from being an advanced or targeted piece of malware.\nApart from this, the origins of EyePyramid‚Äôs malware and its attribution remain a mystery. While the license key registered to Giulio Occhionero‚Äôs name can be considered as strong evidence, it is unclear why a malware author would bother using (simple yet not so trivial) mechanisms to cover their traces (e.g., obfuscation, packing, encryption, disabling security tools), and then mistakenly embed the license key under his name in all of the main variants. Moreover, an analysis of the domain-to-IP historical data of the domain names listed in the court order reveals domains named occhionero.com and occhionero.info, which is again another oddity.\nLatest Update (Just Another Oddity) I received an unexpected email message from someone I\u0026rsquo;ve never heard before. Despite the author of this email is not known in the cyber security community (he presented himself as a PhD Student in medicine at Stanford), he took the time (and money) to verify every single email address written in my analysis and in the court order.\nUsing LeakedSource (now taken down) he had found that one of the compromised email addresses (lu_1974[@]hotmail.com, which is linked to EyePyramid) was used to register on various dating sites. LeakedSource was borderline websites that hosted stolen information, including usernames and passwords.\n ‚Äúthis is probably just a coincidence‚Äù he said but ‚ÄúGiulio also used his @westlands.com address to register to the same dating sites.‚Äù\n Anyways, I\u0026rsquo;ve replied back, thanking him for his work. Then I\u0026rsquo;ve asked him why a Stanford PhD Student in medicine was so interested in such ‚Äúniche‚Äù case (unfolded from the other side of the world), and how he knew that Giulio Occhionero had used his @westlands.com address to register to the same dating sites, because I could not find any evidence about it\nI\u0026rsquo;ve never gotten a reply.\nMedia After getting in touch with Carola Frediani, who did a very good job consolidating all the facts for La Stampa ( Tutti i dettagli e i misteri di EyePyramid), I happily joined the hacker\u0026rsquo;s corner at the International Journalism Festival 2017 in Perugia, a few months later, in a panel moderated by Carola.

As I\u0026rsquo;ve been using machine learning since around 2006, I was immediately hooked by the idea of using it to determine whether an Android app was trying to lock the target device as part of a ransomware scheme.\nThere are three core characteristics that are unavoidable for any ransomware scheme, which can be all boiled down to the \u0026ldquo;business\u0026rdquo; need of \u0026ldquo;being noisy\u0026rdquo; and evident. It\u0026rsquo;s true right? For the first time we see malware that is no longer trying to hide. Instead, it needs to loudly announce its presence to the victim, in order for the business model to work. If the victim is not aware of what is happening and is not effectively guided to the payment screen, the infection is useless.\nTherefore, any ransomware needs to:\n encrypt or lock access to important data, announce its presence to the user and, guide them through the payment options.  These three features have to be implemented by a ransomware sample, and thus have to be visible somehow in the code. Around this key observation, together with the evil genius Nicol√≤ Andronio (the aforementioned Master student) and my partner-in-crime Stefano, we devised and open-sourced HelDroid, a fully automatic APK analyzer that, using static flow analysis, detects whether an app contains evidence of ransomware behavior.\nEarlier this summer I\u0026rsquo;ve joined Trend Micro\u0026rsquo;s research team, and immediately got my hands onto MARS, its Mobile App Reputation Service, which allowed me to build a good retrospective view of how Android ransomware have evolved.\nThis work granted me a speaking slot at the Black Hat Europe Briefings, where I had the opportunity to present the results to a room packed with attendees.

Indeed, the remarkable amount of illicit profit and the cybercriminals‚Äô increasing interest in ransomware schemes suggest that a fair number of users are actually paying the ransoms. Unfortunately, pure-detection approaches (e.g., based on analysis sandboxes or pipelines) are not sufficient nowadays, because often we do not have the luxury of being able to isolate a sample to analyze, and when this happens it is already too late for several users! We believe that a forwardlooking solution is to equip modern operating systems with practical self-healing capabilities against this serious threat. Towards such a vision, we propose ShieldFS, an add-on driver that makes the Windows native filesystem immune to ransomware attacks. For each running process, ShieldFS dynamically toggles a protection layer that acts as a copy-onwrite mechanism, according to the outcome of its detection component. Internally, ShieldFS monitors the low-level filesystem activity to update a set of adaptive models that profile the system activity over time. Whenever one or more processes violate these models, their operations are deemed malicious and the side effects on the filesystem are transparently rolled back.  We designed ShieldFS after an analysis of billions of low-level, I/O filesystem requests generated by thousands of benign applications, which we collected from clean machines in use by real users for about one month. This is the first measurement on the filesystem activity of a large set of benign applications in real working conditions. We evaluated ShieldFS in real-world working conditions on real, personal machines, against samples from state of the art ransomware families. ShieldFS was able to detect the malicious activity at runtime and transparently recover all the original files. Although the models can be tuned to fit various filesystem usage profiles, our results show that our initial tuning yields high accuracy even on unseen samples and variants.","tags":null,"title":"ShieldFS: A Self-healing, Ransomware-aware Filesystem","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi","Stefano Zanero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1478131200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591348035,"objectID":"c23c71c915fa9e2b9e1919bd6e75e6db","permalink":"/talk/maggi_greateatlonbheu_talk_2016/","publishdate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/maggi_greateatlonbheu_talk_2016/","section":"talk","summary":"While we have grown accustomed to stealthy malware, specifically written to gain and maintain control of the victim machines to abuse their resources, ransomware really comes as a \"plot twist\"! After 10+ years of stealthy malware, spread mainly for building botnets and steal information, for the second time we're witnessing a growth of disruptive malware, and an interest for direct and fast profit. Ransomware is a particularly striking example of disruptive malware, both on mobile and desktop targets: While traditional mass malware must fly under the radar to fulfill its goals, a ransomware attack that remains unaccountable has failed miserably. It must show up to inform and frighten the victim! As a result, the human psychological response to the attack plays a significant role in the success of ransomware schemes. And, given the remarkable revenue, the scheme seems to be working fairly well.  This talk will describe the technical impact of disruptive malware and its game-changing approach, which made us (at least) rethink our incident-response plans. We will focus on mobile ransomware as a representative, extreme case study. Albeit not very studied, we are currently tracking 10 distinct families, and collected tenths of thousands distinct samples in three months. In this talk, we will go through the most notorious families such as Koler, SLocker, Svpeng (and mention the other notable ones), overviewing their social-engineering tricks and how they are technically implemented. This will include, for instance, how an app can effectively lock a device to forcefully display the typical threatening message that informs the victim of what just happened, or how crypto and file-system APIs are (ab)used to surreptitiously encrypt the valuable data.  After having overviewed these aspects, we will describe how they can be effectively detected with specific static features. We will present a lightweight Smali emulator to track the instruction sequences that implement device-locking mechanisms. To detect malicious encryption attempts, we will present a static, dataflow-based program-analysis technique and tool that track file-system operations (e.g., file listing, file reading) to determine if they are \"connected\" to encryption flows. Since the most recent families have started to abuse the device-administration API (e.g., to lock the device), obfuscated method names and reflection to hinder automatic static analysis, we will show a couple of counter-tricks. Last, we will show how the threatening messages can be recognized from normal text using a language-analysis technique, which classifies text based on the appearance of key terms frequently found in ransomware samples but not in benign sources. Since static program-analysis approaches like ours can be time and resource consuming, we describe a fast triaging pre-filtering technique to quickly discard strikingly benign applications. This filter is generic and ransomware-agnostic. Thus, in principle, it could be applied to any app-vetting pipeline.  With this talk we will release the source code of a prototype that implements (part of) the described techniques, and a dataset comprising tenths of thousands of ransomware applications targeting the Android platform, each labeled with the set of features that characterize their statically-extracted behavior.","tags":null,"title":"Pocket-sized Badness: Why Ransomware Comes as a Plot Twist in the Cat-Mouse Game","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Vasilios Mavroudis","Shuang Hao","Yanick Fratantonio","Federico Maggi","Giovanni Vigna","Christopher Kruegel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1478131200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591348035,"objectID":"eb45d4bb421b199e2fea203e56872688","permalink":"/talk/mavroudis_silverdogbh_talk_2016/","publishdate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/mavroudis_silverdogbh_talk_2016/","section":"talk","summary":"Cross-device tracking (XDT) technologies are currently the ``Holy Grail'' for marketers because they allow to track the user's visited content across different devices to then push relevant, more targeted content. For example, if a user clicks on a particular advertisement while browsing the web at home, the advertisers are very interested in collecting this information to display, later on, related advertisements on other devices belonging to the same user (e.g., phone, tablet).  Currently, the most recent innovation in this area is ultrasonic cross-device tracking (uXDT), which is the use of the ultrasonic spectrum as a communication channel to \"pair\" devices for the aforementioned tracking purposes. Technically, this pairing happens through a receiver application installed on the phone or tablet. The business model is that users will receive rewards or useful services for keeping those apps active, pretty much like it happens for proximity-marketing apps (e.g., Shopkick), where users receive deals for walk-ins recorded by their indoor-localizing apps.  This talk will describe and demonstrate the practical security and privacy risks that arise with the adoption of uXDT-enabled systems. The uXDT technology has caught the attention of major companies (e.g., IDG Ventures, Google, Nestle, Dominos), many of which either invested in uXDT providers (e.g., SilverPush, Signal360, Audible Magic), or approached such companies as clients. Unfortunately, unbeknownst to the users, we found that numerous mobile applications, some with millions of downloads, include uXDT advertising frameworks that actively listen for ultrasounds, with no opt-out option for the users! Security experts and the authorities (e.g., the Federal Trade Commission) have promptly raised concerns about uXDT, but until now no comprehensive security analysis of the technology has been released.  In this talk, we will explore the uXDT ecosystem, dig into the inner workings of popular uXDT frameworks, and perform an in-depth technical analysis of the underlying technology, exposing both implementation \u0026 design vulnerabilities, and critical security \u0026 privacy shortcomings that we discovered. In the offensive part of our talk, we will demonstrate (through practical demo sessions) how an attacker can exploit uXDT frameworks to reveal the true IP addresses of users who browse the Internet through anonymity networks (e.g., VPNs or Tor). Moreover, we will describe how an attacker can tamper with the \"pairing\" process or affect the results of the advertising/bidding algorithms. For example, an attacker equipped with a simple beacon-emitting device (e.g., a smartphone) can walk into a Starbucks at peak hour and launch a profile-corruption attack against all customers currently taking advantage of uXDT-enabled apps.  In the defensive part of our talk, we will introduce three countermeasures that we designed, implemented, and will publicly release. These include (1) a mobile application that detects ultrasound beacons \"in the air\" with the goal of raising awareness, (2) a browser extension that acts as a personal firewall by selectively filtering ultrasonic beacons, and (3) an brand-new OS permission control in Android that allows applications to declaratively ask access to the ultrasound spectrum. We will go into the technical details and provide remediation advice useful both for the users and developers.","tags":null,"title":"Talking Behind Your Back: Attacks and Countermeasures of Ultrasonic Cross-Device Tracking","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Chenghyu Zheng","Nicola Della Rocca","Niccol√≤ Andronio","Stefano Zanero","Maggi Federico"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1476057600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591345282,"objectID":"aff61b2bc341c106df91a6cd0a1adccf","permalink":"/publication/zheng_greateatlon_2016/","publishdate":"2016-10-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zheng_greateatlon_2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Ransomware is a class of malware that aim at preventing victims from accessing valuable data, typically via data encryption or device locking, and ask for a payment to release the target. In the past year, instances of ransomware attacks have been spotted on mobile devices too. However, despite their relatively low infection rate, we notice that the techniques used by mobile ransomware are quite sophisticated, and different from those used by ransomware against traditional computers.  Through an in-depth analysis of about 100 samples of currently active ransomware apps, we conclude that most of them pass undetected by state-of-the-art tools, which are unable to recognize the abuse of benign features for malicious purposes. The main reason is that such tools rely on an inadequate and incomplete set of features. The most notable examples are the abuse of reflection and device-administration APIs, appearing in modern ransomware to evade analysis and detection, and to elevate their privileges (e.g., to lock or wipe the device). Moreover, current solutions introduce several false positives in the na Ãàƒ±ve way they detect cryptographic-APIs abuse, flagging goodware apps as ransomware merely because they rely on cryptographic libraries. Last but not least, the performance overhead of current approaches is unacceptable for appstore-scale workloads.  In this work, we tackle the aforementioned limitations and propose GreatEatlon, a next-generation mobile ransomware detector. We foresee GreatEatlon deployed on the appstore side, as a preventive countermeasure. At its core, GreatEatlon uses static program-analysis techniques to ``resolve'' reflection-based, anti-analysis attempts, to recognize abuses of the device administration API, and extract accurate data-flow information required to detect truly malicious uses of cryptographic APIs. Given the significant resources utilized by Great- Eatlon, we prepend to its core a fast pre-filter that quickly discards obvious goodware, in order to avoid wasting computer cycles.  We tested GreatEatlon on thousands of samples of goodware, generic malware and ransomware applications, and showed that it surpasses current approaches both in speed and detection capabilities, while keeping the false negative rate below 1.3%.

These tools can be used to analyze potentially malicious or untrusted programs. In this setting, it is important to prevent that the target program determines whether it is being traced or not. This is typically achieved by minimizing the code of the introspection routines and any artifact or side-effect that the program can leverage. Indeed, the most recent approaches consist of lightly instrumented operating systems or thin hypervisors running directly on bare metal.  Following this research trend, we investigate the feasibility of transparently tracing a Linux/ARM program without modifying the software stack, while keeping the analysis cost and flexibility compatible with state of the art emulation- or bare-metal-based approaches. As for the typical program tracing task, our goal is to reconstruct the stream of system call invocations along with the respective un-marshalled arguments.  We propose to leverage the availability of on-chip debugging interfaces of modern ARM systems, which are accessible via JTAG. More precisely, we developed OpenST, an open-source prototype tracer that allowed us to analyze the performance overhead and to assess the transparency with respect to evasive, real-world malicious programs. OpenST has two tracing modes: In-kernel dynamic tracing and external tracing. The in-kernel dynamic tracing mode uses the JTAG interface to ``hot-patch'' the system calls at runtime, injecting introspection code. This mode is more transparent than emulator based approaches, but assumes that the traced program does not have access to the kernel memory where the introspection code is loaded. The external tracing mode removes this assumption by using the JTAG interface to manage hardware breakpoints.  Our tests show that OpenST's greater transparency comes at the price of a steep performance penalty. However, with a cost model, we show that OpenST scales better than the state of the art, bare-metal-based approach, while remaining equally stealthy to evasive malware.","tags":null,"title":"On-Chip System Call Tracing: A Feasibility Study and Open Prototype","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mila Dalla Preda","Federico Maggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1474329600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591520876,"objectID":"c6fb80218ad548f9556b44049a49ce19","permalink":"/publication/dalla-preda_aamo_article_2016/","publishdate":"2016-09-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dalla-preda_aamo_article_2016/","section":"publication","summary":"The authors of mobile-malware have started to leverage program protection techniques to circumvent anti-viruses, or simply hinder reverse engineering.

However, comparatively little assistance is available for defining and enforcing access control policies within multiuser applications. These applications, often found in enterprise environments, allow multiple users to operate at different privilege levels in terms of exercising application functionality and accessing data. Developers of such applications bear a heavy burden in ensuring that security policies over code and data in this setting are properly expressed and enforced. We present Trellis, an approach for expressing hierarchical access control policies in applications and enforcing these policies during execution. The approach enhances the development toolchain to allow programmers to partially annotate code and data with simple privilege level tags, and uses a static analysis to infer suitable tags for the entire application. At runtime, policies are extracted from the resulting binaries and are enforced by a modified operating system kernel.

In this paper, we propose, design, implement and test Grab 'n Run, a novel code verification protocol and a series of supporting libraries, APIs, and components, that address the problem by abstracting away from the developer challenging implementation details. Grab 'n Run is designed to be practical: among its tools, it provides a drop-in library, which requires no modifications to the Android framework or the underlying Dalvik/ART runtime, is very similar to the native API, and most code can be automatically rewritten to use it. Grab 'n Run also contains an application rewriting tool, which allows easy porting of existing applications to use the secure API of its library. We evaluate Grab 'n Run library with a user study, obtaining impressive results in vulnerability reduction, ease of use and speed of development. We also show that the performance overhead introduced by our library is negligible.

Existing access control mechanisms are too coarse-grained to handle cases of conflicting interests between the users associated with a photo; stories of embarrassing or inappropriate photos being widely accessible have become quite common. In this paper, we propose to rethink access control when applied to photos, in a way that allows us to effectively prevent unwanted individuals from recognizing users in a photo. The core concept behind our approach is to change the granularity of access control from the level of the photo to that of a user's personally identifiable information (PII). In this work, we consider the face as the PII. When another user attempts to access a photo, the system determines which faces the user does not have the permission to view, and presents the photo with the restricted faces blurred out. Our system takes advantage of the existing face recognition functionality of social networks, and can interoperate with the current photo-level access control mechanisms. We implement a proof-of-concept application for Facebook, and demonstrate that the performance overhead of our approach is minimal. We also conduct a user study to evaluate the privacy offered by our approach, and find that it effectively prevents users from identifying their contacts in 87.35% of the restricted photos. Finally, our study reveals the misconceptions about the privacy offered by existing mechanisms, and demonstrates that users are positive towards the adoption of an intuitive, straightforward access control mechanism that allows them to manage the visibility of their face in published photos.","tags":null,"title":"Face/Off: Preventing Privacy Leakage From Photos in Social Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Niccol√≤ Andronio","Stefano Zanero","Federico Maggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1443657600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591345282,"objectID":"c08c444e321d908caf65659f764f3c04","permalink":"/publication/andronio_heldroid_2015/","publishdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/andronio_heldroid_2015/","section":"publication","summary":"In ransomware attacks, the actual target is the human, as opposed to the classic attacks that abuse the infected devices (e.g., botnet renting, information stealing). Mobile devices are by no means immune to ransomware attacks. However, there is little research work on this matter and only traditional protections are available. Even state-of-the-art mobile malware detection approaches are ineffective against ransomware apps because of the subtle attack scheme. As a consequence, the ample attack surface formed by the billion mobile devices is left unprotected. First, in this work we summarize the results of our analysis of the existing mobile ransomware families, describing their common characteristics. Second, we present HelDroid, a fast, efficient and fully automated approach that recognizes known and unknown scareware and ransomware samples from goodware. Our approach is based on detecting the ``build- ing blocks'' that are typically needed to implement a mobile ransomware application. Specifically, HelDroid detects, in a generic way, if an app is attempting to lock or encrypt the device without the user‚Äôs consent, and if ransom requests are displayed on the screen. Our technique works without requiring that a sample of a certain family is available beforehand. We implemented HelDroid and tested it on real-world Android ransomware samples. On a large dataset comprising hundreds of thousands of APKs including goodware, malware, scareware, and ransomware, HelDroid exhibited nearly zero false positives and the capability of recognizing unknown ransomware samples.

Such patterns are often part of the skill set of the analyst, sometimes implemented in manually-created post-processing scripts. It would be desirable to be able to automatically find such behaviors, present them to analysts, and create a systematic catalog of matching rules and relevant implementations. We propose Jackdaw, a system that finds interesting dynamic patterns, and ranks them to unveil potentially interesting behaviors. Then, it annotates them with static information, capturing the distinct implementations of each across different malware families. Finally, Jackdaw associates semantic information to the behaviors, so as to create a descriptive summary that helps the analysts in querying the catalog of behaviors by type. To do this, it leverages the dynamic information and an indexed Web-based knowledge databases. We implement and demonstrate Jackdaw on the Win32 API (even if the technique can be generalized to any OS). On a dataset of 2,136 distinct binaries, including both malicious and benign libraries and executables, we compared the behaviors extracted automatically against a ground truth of 44 behaviors created manually by expert analysts. Jackdaw found 77.3% of them and was able to exclude spurious behaviors in 99.6% cases. We also discovered 466 novel behaviors, among which manual exploration and review by expert reverse engineers revealed interesting findings and confirmed the correctness of the semantic tagging.","tags":null,"title":"Jackdaw: Towards Automatic Reverse Engineering of Large Datasets of Binaries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1433289600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591348035,"objectID":"72921ae458296e6af65e0a3d44f80a4a","permalink":"/talk/maggi_mobileransomware_talk_2015/","publishdate":"2015-06-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/maggi_mobileransomware_talk_2015/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Mobile Ransomware","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1429488000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591348035,"objectID":"75510c7d6c69dd05546070cbe59d2bbb","permalink":"/talk/maggi_cybercrimethreatanalysis_talk_2015/","publishdate":"2015-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/maggi_cybercrimethreatanalysis_talk_2015/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"From Cybercrime to Threat Analysis","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Michele Carminati","Roberto Caron","Federico Maggi","Ilenia Epifani","Stefano Zanero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1427846400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591520876,"objectID":"9617b4d52b72d2308f7cc547a4fdc800","permalink":"/publication/carminati_banksealer_article_2015/","publishdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/carminati_banksealer_article_2015/","section":"publication","summary":"The significant growth of online banking frauds, fueled by the underground economy of malware, raised the need for effective fraud analysis systems. Unfortunately, almost all of the existing approaches adopt black box models and mechanisms that do not give any justifications to analysts. Also, the development of such methods is stifled by limited Internet banking data availability for the scientific community. In this paper we describe BankSealer, a decision support system for online banking fraud analysis and investigation. During a training phase, BankSealer builds easy-to-understand models for each customer's spending habits, based on past transactions. First, it quantifies the anomaly of each transaction with respect to the customer historical profile. Second, it finds global clusters of customers with similar spending habits. Third, it uses a temporal threshold system that measures the anomaly of the current spending pattern of each customer, with respect to his or her past spending behavior. With this threefold profiling approach, it mitigates the under-training due to the lack of historical data for building well-trained profiles, and the evolution of users' spending habits over time. At runtime, BankSealer supports analysts by ranking new transactions that deviate from the learned profiles, with an output that has an easily understandable, immediate statistical meaning.  Our evaluation on real data, based on fraud scenarios built in collaboration with domain experts that replicate typical, real-world attacks (e.g., credential stealing, banking trojan activity, and frauds repeated over time), shows that our approach correctly ranks complex frauds. In particular, we measure the effectiveness, the computational resource requirements and the capabilities of BankSealer to mitigate the problem of users that performed a low number of transactions. Our system ranks frauds and anomalies with up to 98% detection rate and with a maximum daily computation time of 4~min. Given the good results, a leading Italian bank deployed a version of BankSealer in their environment to analyze frauds.","tags":null,"title":"BankSealer: A decision support system for online banking fraud analysis and investigation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1426636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591348035,"objectID":"4cf1e75c310d0b9fa50e3a884fcf3444","permalink":"/talk/maggi_threatanalysis_talk_2015/","publishdate":"2015-03-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/maggi_threatanalysis_talk_2015/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"From Cybercrime to Threat Analysis","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Sono stato invitato dal Garante per la Protezione dei Dati alla giornata europea della privacy, con richiesta di fare un po' di chiarezza sul fenomeno IoT.

Recent research, however, demonstrated that attackers can bypass the mechanism by employing face recognition software. Here we demonstrate an alternative attack. that employs image comparison techniques to identify the SA photos within an offline collection of the users' photos. In this paper, we revisit the concept of SA and design a system with a novel photo selection and transformation process, which generates challenges that are robust against these attacks. The intuition behind our photo selection is to use photos. that fail software-based face recognition, while remaining recognizable to humans who are familiar with the depicted people. The photo transformation process. creates challenges in the form of photo collages, where faces are transformed so as to render image matching techniques ineffective. We experimentally confirm the robustness of our approach against three template. matching algorithms that solve 0.4 percent of the challenges, while requiring four orders of magnitude more processing effort. Furthermore, when the transformations are applied, face detection software fails to detect even a single face. Our user studies confirm that users are able to identify their friends in over 99% of the photos with faces unrecognizable by software, and can solve over 94 percent of the challenges with transformed photos.","tags":null,"title":"Faces in the Distorting Mirror: Revisiting Photo-based Social Authentication","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Enrico Bazzoli","Claudio Criscione","Federico Maggi","Stefano Zanero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1413331200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591348204,"objectID":"09dcfeb089aea9f43f39f5ccde9ae3d5","permalink":"/publication/bazzoli_xsspeeker_tr_2014/","publishdate":"2014-10-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bazzoli_xsspeeker_tr_2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Since the first publication of the \"OWASP Top 10\" (2004), cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities have always been among the top 5 web application security bugs. Black-box vulnerability scanners are widely used in the industry to reproduce (XSS) attacks automatically. In spite of the technical sophistication and advancement, previous work showed that black-box scanners miss a non-negligible portion of vulnerabilities, and report non-existing, non-exploitable or uninteresting vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, these results hold true even for XSS vulnerabilities, which are relatively simple to trigger if compared, for instance, to logic flaws. Black-box scanners have not been studied in depth on this vertical: knowing precisely how scanners try to detect XSS can provide useful insights to understand their limitations, to design better detection methods. In this paper, we present and discuss the results of a detailed and systematic study on 6 black-box web scanners (both proprietary and open source) that we conducted in coordination with the respective vendors. To this end, we developed an automated tool to (1) extract the payloads used by each scanner, (2) distill the \"templates\" that have originated each payload, (3) evaluate them according to quality indicators, and (4) perform a cross-scanner analysis. Unlike previous work, our testbed application, which contains a large set of XSS vulnerabilities, including DOM XSS, was gradually retrofitted to accomodate for the payloads that triggered no vulnerabilities. Our analysis reveals a highly fragmented scenario. Scanners exhibit a wide variety of distinct payloads, a non-uniform approach to fuzzing and mutating the payloads, and a very diverse detection effectiveness.","tags":null,"title":"XSS Peeker: A Systematic Analysis of Cross-site Scripting Vulnerability Scanners","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1413158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591348035,"objectID":"2fa4f96dc8b735c8a885435cdf9a7924","permalink":"/talk/maggi_cybercrime_talk_2014/","publishdate":"2014-10-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/maggi_cybercrime_talk_2014/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Current and Future Cybercrime Tactics","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1412985600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591348035,"objectID":"b592078e106579681cabc188e2a8a22d","permalink":"/talk/maggi_andradar_talk_2014/","publishdate":"2014-10-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/maggi_andradar_talk_2014/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Come to the Dark Side: We have Apps!","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1411603200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591348035,"objectID":"c42c933614351fefeae139d9e2626d79","permalink":"/talk/maggi_androidre_talk_2014/","publishdate":"2014-09-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/maggi_androidre_talk_2014/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Static Analysis of Android Applications","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Alessio Antonini","Federico Maggi","Stefano Zanero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1409529600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591345282,"objectID":"9c8ef501e8cb897436278cacff6b8dc2","permalink":"/publication/antonini_knxmalware_2014/","publishdate":"2014-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/antonini_knxmalware_2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Building automation systems rely heavily on general-purpose computers and communication protocols, which are often affected by security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we first analyze the attack surface of a real building automation system - based on the widely used KNX protocol-connected to a general-purpose IP network. To this end, we analyze the vulnerabilities of KNX-based networks highlighted by previous research work, which, however, did not corroborate their findings with experimental results. To verify the practical exploitability of these vulnerabilities and their potential impact, we implement a full-fledged testbed infrastructure that reproduces the typical deployment of a building automation system. On this testbed, we show the feasibility of a practical attack that leverages and combines the aforementioned vulnerabilities. We show the ease of reverse engineering the vendor-specific components of the KNX protocol. Our attack leverages the IP-to-KNX connectivity to send arbitrary commands which are executed by the actuators. We conclude that the vulnerabilities highlighted by previous work are effectively exploitable in practice, with severe results. Although we use KNX as a target, our work can be generalized to other communication protocols, often characterized by similar issues. Finally, we analyze the countermeasures proposed in previous literature and reveal the limitations that prevent their adoption in practice. We suggest a practical stopgap measure to protect real KNX-based BASs from our attack.","tags":null,"title":"A Practical Attack Against a KNX-based Building Automation System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Iasonas Polakis","Federico Maggi","Stefano Zanero","Angelos D.

We first conclude that it is better to adequately describe the potential ethical concerns from the very beginning and plan ahead the institutional review board (IRB) request. Even though sometimes optional, the IRB approval is a valuable point from the reviewer's perspective. Another aspect that needs planning is getting in touch with the online social network security team, which takes a substantial amount of time. With their support, \"bending the rules\" (e.g., using scrapers) when the experimental goals require so, is easier. Clearly, in cases where critical technical vulnerabilities are found during the research, the general recommendations for responsible disclosure should be followed. Gaining the audience's engagement and trust was essential to the success of our user study. Participants felt more comfortable when subscribing to our experiments, and also responsibly reported bugs and glitches. We did not observe the same behavior in crowd-sourcing workers, who were instead more interested in obtaining their rewards. On a related point, our experience suggests that crowd sourcing should not be used alone: Setting up tasks is more time consuming than it seems, and researchers must insert some sentinel checks to ensure that workers are not submitting random answers.From a logistics point of view, we learned that having at least a high-level plan of the experiments pays back, especially when the IRB requires a detailed description of the work and the data to be collected. However, over planning can be dangerous because the measurement goals can change dynamically. From a technical point of view, partially connected to the logistics remarks, having a complex and large data-gathering and analysis framework may be counterproductive in terms of set-up a- d management overhead. From our experience we suggest to choose simple technologies that scale up if needed but, more importantly, can scale down. For example, launching a quick query should be straightforward, and the frameworks should not impose too much overhead for formulating it. We conclude with a series of practical recommendations on how to successfully collect data from online social networks (e.g., using techniques for network multipresence, mimicking user behavior, and other crawling \"tricks\"') and avoid abusing the online service, while gathering the data required by the experiments.","tags":["workshop"],"title":"Security and Privacy Measurements on Social Networks: Experiences and Lessons Learned","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1406419200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591348035,"objectID":"160773bb47f16f1f0a3bca8bf6866639","permalink":"/talk/maggi_virtualization_talk_2014/","publishdate":"2014-07-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/maggi_virtualization_talk_2014/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Virtualization","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Martina Lindorfer","Stamatis Volanis","Alessandro Sisto","Matthias Neugschwandtner","Elias Athanasopoulos","Federico Maggi","Christian Platzer","Stefano Zanero","Sotiris Ioannidis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1404172800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591345282,"objectID":"622e79b12dd0073b8be40558b0f66259","permalink":"/publication/lindorfer_andradar_2014/","publishdate":"2014-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lindorfer_andradar_2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Compared to traditional desktop software, Android applications are delivered through software repositories, commonly known as application markets. Other mobile platforms, such as Apple iOS and BlackBerry OS also use the marketplace model, but what is unique to Android is the existence of a plethora of alternative application markets. This complicates the task of detecting and tracking Android malware. Identifying a malicious application in one particular market is simply not enough, as many instances of this application may exist in other markets. To quantify this phenomenon, we exhaustively crawled 8 markets between June and November 2013. Our findings indicate that alternative markets host a large number of ad-aggressive apps, a non-negligible amount of malware, and some markets even allow authors to publish known malicious apps without prompt action. Motivated by these findings, we present AndRadar, a framework for discovering multiple instances of a malicious Android application in a set of alternative application markets. AndRadar scans a set of markets in parallel to discover similar applications. Each lookup takes no more than a few seconds, regardless of the size of the marketplace. Moreover, it is modular, and new markets can be transparently added once the search and download URLs are known. Using AndRadar we are able to achieve three goals. First, we can discover malicious applications in alternative markets, second, we can expose app distribution strategies used by malware developers, and third, we can monitor how different markets react to new malware. During a three-month evaluation period, AndRadar tracked over 20,000 apps and recorded more than 1,500 app deletions in 16 markets. Nearly 8% of those deletions were related to apps that were hopping from market to market. The most established markets were able to react and delete new malware within tens of days from the malicious app publication date while other markets did not react at all.","tags":null,"title":"AndRadar: Fast Discovery of Android Applications in Alternative Markets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stefano Schiavoni","Federico Maggi","Lorenzo Cavallaro","Stefano Zanero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1404172800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591345282,"objectID":"f65b4aa43f0653c5788be119e53fb248","permalink":"/publication/schiavoni_phoenix_2014/","publishdate":"2014-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schiavoni_phoenix_2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Modern botnets rely on domain-generation algorithms (DGAs) to build resilient command-and-control infrastructures.

In this paper, we investigate the ecosystem of these increasingly popular ad-based URL shortening services. Even though traditional URL shortening services have been thoroughly investigated in previous research, we argue that, due to the monetary incentives and the presence of third-party advertising networks, ad-based URL shortening services and their users are exposed to more hazards than traditional shortening services. By analyzing the services themselves, the advertisers involved, and their users, we uncover a series of issues that are actively exploited by malicious advertisers and endanger the users.

The data it contains is difficult to analyze manually, but can yield a high number of relevant information.  In this paper we present a modular framework, BitIodine, which parses the blockchain, clusters addresses that are likely to belong to a same user or group of users, classifies such users and labels them, and finally visualizes complex information extracted from the Bitcoin network.  BitIodine labels users (semi-)automatically with information on their identity and actions which is automatically scraped from openly available information sources. BitIodine also supports manual investigation by finding paths and reverse paths between addresses or users.

Mobile application analysis is indeed inherently different from desktop application analysis: In the latter, the interaction of the user (i.e., victim) is crucial for the malware to correctly expose all its malicious behaviors. We propose a novel approach to analyze (malicious) mobile applications. The goal is to exercise the user interface (UI) of an Android application to effectively trigger malicious behaviors, automatically. Our key intuition is to record and reproduce the UI interactions of a potential victim of the malware, so as to stimulate the relevant behaviors during dynamic analysis. To make our approach scale, we automatically re-execute the recorded UI interactions on apps that are similar to the original ones. These characteristics make our system orthogonal and complementary to current dynamic analysis and UI-exercising approaches. We developed our approach and experimentally shown that our stimulation allows to reach a higher code coverage than automatic UI exercisers, so to unveil interesting malicious behaviors that are not exposed when using other approaches. Our approach is also suitable for crowdsourcing scenarios, which would push further the collection of new stimulation traces. This can potentially change the way we conduct dynamic analysis of (mobile) applications, from fully automatic only, to user-centric and collaborative too.","tags":null,"title":"PuppetDroid: A User-Centric UI Exerciser for Automatic Dynamic Analysis of Similar Android Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388707200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591348035,"objectID":"13fdcf160e4b53841c1eb5848229c738","permalink":"/talk/maggi_androidmalware_talk_2014/","publishdate":"2014-01-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/maggi_androidmalware_talk_2014/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Malicious Android Apps: Overview, Status and Dilemmas","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Gabriele Bonetti","Marco Viglione","Alessandro Frossi","Federico Maggi","Stefano Zanero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1385856000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591345282,"objectID":"8d3a4a6e04f11c7d7e9416cfec7dca25","permalink":"/publication/bonetti_ssdforensics_2013/","publishdate":"2013-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bonetti_ssdforensics_2013/","section":"publication","summary":"Solid-state drives (SSDs) are inherently different from traditional drives, as they incorporate data-optimization mechanisms to overcome their limitations (such as a limited number of program-erase cycles, or the need of blanking a block before writing). The most common optimizations are wear leveling, trimming, compression, and garbage collection, which operate transparently to the host OS and, in certain cases, even when the disks are disconnected from a computer (but still powered up). In simple words, SSD controllers are designed to hide these internals completely, rendering them inaccessible if not through direct acquisition of the memory cells. These optimizations have a significant impact on the forensic analysis of SSDs. The main cause is that memory cells could be pre-emptively blanked, whereas a traditional drive sector would need to be explicitly rewritten to physically wipe off the data. Unfortunately, the existing literature on this subject is sparse and the conclusions are seemingly contradictory. In this paper we propose a generic, practical, test-driven methodology that guides researchers and forensics analysts through a series of steps that assess the \"forensic friendliness\" of a SSD. Given a drive of the same brand and model of the one under analysis, our methodology produces a decision that helps an analyst to determine whether or not an expensive direct acquisition of the memory cells is worth the effort, because the extreme optimizations may have rendered the data unreadable or useless. We apply our methodology to three SSDs produced by top vendors (Samsung, Corsair, and Crucial), and provide a detailed description of how each step should be conducted.","tags":null,"title":"A Comprehensive Black-box Methodology for Testing the Forensic Characteristics of Solid-state Drives","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stefano Schiavoni","Federico Maggi","Lorenzo Cavallaro","Stefano Zanero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1384992000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591348204,"objectID":"86def92ce196124b6c479d61a911ff74","permalink":"/publication/schiavoni_phoenix_tr_2013/","publishdate":"2013-11-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schiavoni_phoenix_tr_2013/","section":"publication","summary":"Modern botnets rely on domain-generation algorithms (DGAs) to build resilient command-and-control infrastructures.

An indirect measure of this trend is the increasing amount of security threats against mobile devices, which in turn created a demand for protection tools. Protection tools, unfortunately, add an additional burden for the smartphone's battery power, which is a precious resource. This observation motivates the need for smarter (security) applications, designed and capable of running within adaptive energy goals. Although this problem affects other areas, in the security area this research direction is referred to as \"green security\". In general, a fundamental need to the researches toward creating energy-aware applications, consist in having appropriate power models that capture the full dynamic of devices and users. This is not an easy task because of the highly dynamic environment and usage habits. In practice, this goal requires easy mechanisms to measure the power consumption and approaches to create accurate models. The existing approaches that tackle this problem are either not accurate or not applicable in practice due to their limiting requirements. We propose MPower, a power-sensing platform and adaptive power modeling platform for Android mobile devices. The MPower approach creates an adequate and precise knowledge base of the power \"behavior\" of several different devices and users, which allows us to create better device-centric power models that considers the main hardware components and how they contributed to the overall power consumption. In this paper we consolidate our perspective work on MPower by providing the implementation details and evaluation on 278 users and about 22.5 million power-related data.

To this end, we monitored 622 distinct URL shortening services between March 2010 and April 2012, and collected 24,953,881 distinct short URLs. With this large dataset, we studied the abuse of short URLs. Despite short URLs are a significant, new security risk, in accordance with the reports resulting from the observation of the overall phishing and spamming activity, we found that only a relatively small fraction of users ever encountered malicious short URLs. Interestingly, during the second year of measurement, we noticed an increased percentage of short URLs being abused for drive-by download campaigns and a decreased percentage of short URLs being abused for spam campaigns. In addition to these security-related findings, our unique monitoring infrastructure and large dataset allowed us to complement previous research on short URLs and analyze these web services from the user's perspective.","tags":null,"title":"Two years of short URLs internet measurement: security threats and countermeasures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1364774400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591348035,"objectID":"111d84fe8ac8efa111a2eb660af62a12","permalink":"/talk/maggi_soauth_talk_2013/","publishdate":"2013-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/maggi_soauth_talk_2013/","section":"talk","summary":"Two-factor authentication is widely used by high-value services to prevent adversaries from compromising accounts using stolen credentials.

Malware development thus plays an essential role in the underground economy of cyber-crime. Malware authors regularly update their software to defeat defenses or to support new or improved criminal business models. A large body of research has focused on detecting malware, defending against it and identifying its functionality. In addition to these goals, however, the analysis of malware can provide a glimpse into the software development industry that develops malicious code. In this work, we present techniques to observe the evolution of a malware family over time. First, we develop techniques to compare versions of malicious code and quantify their differences. Furthermore, we use behavior observed from dynamic analysis to assign semantics to binary code and to identify functional components within a malware binary. By combining these techniques, we are able to monitor the evolution of a malware's functional components. We implement these techniques in a system we call BEAGLE, and apply it to the observation of 16 malware strains over several months. The results of these experiments provide insight into the effort involved in updating malware code, and show that BEAGLE can identify changes to individual malware components.","tags":null,"title":"Lines of Malicious Code: Insights Into the Malicious Software Industry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roman Kochanek","Andrea Dardanelli","Federico Maggi","Stefano Zanero","Mara Tanelli","Sergio Savaresi","Thorsten Holz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1338508800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591348204,"objectID":"0031e9f855887c3d9a1e8d74e4c6e1e1","permalink":"/publication/kochanek_cartox_tr_2012/","publishdate":"2012-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kochanek_cartox_tr_2012/","section":"publication","summary":"Modern vehicles, and in particular electric vehicles, are increasingly being equipped with interconnected computer systems, which collect information through vehicular sources and remote, Internet-connected services. Unfortunately, this creates a non-negligible attack surface, which extends even more when vehicles are integrated with smartphones to offer advanced services. In fact, embedded systems on vehicles have been developed to address safety, not security requirements. Furthermore, vehicles have real-time constraints, and the typical embedded architectures used on board significantly complicate security designs. In this paper, we introduce a communication framework that addresses these challenges and we demonstrate how a smartphone can interact with a vehicle in a secure and safe manner. To this end, we design a security session layer that ensures end-to-end security transparently. We conduct an experimental evaluation on a real implementation of our security layer, which shows that our solution is practical and easy to use, satisfies performance constraints, and meets real-time requirements by taking into account the limited capabilities of our target architecture. More precisely, we implement our approach for an electrically-powered two-wheeler manufactured by Piaggio, and show how a smartphone can interact via a wireless link with the battery-life controller in a secure manner. Interestingly, our approach is not limited to vehicles, but can be used in other application domains where a smartphone needs to securely interact with an embedded device.","tags":null,"title":"Secure Integration of Mobile Devices for Automotive Services","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1335830400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591348035,"objectID":"b12685e193888abc7ea257849b4646ff","permalink":"/talk/maggi_longshore_talk_2012/","publishdate":"2012-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/maggi_longshore_talk_2012/","section":"talk","summary":"I gave a talk based on these slides for the first time at Royal Holloway University of London, in April 2012.

On this dataset, which comprises 16,075,693 distinct short URLs, we first precisely characterized the usage habits observed during our collection process, and the content typically referred by short URLs: Users exhibit different usage habits depending on the type of content they are using short URLs for. We then analyzed the abuse of short URLs to hide the true URL of malicious pages: This practice is not widespread, although we noticed that the miscreants tend to post the same malicious short URL on multiple pages. Finally, we analyzed the countermeasures of shortening services against abuses of short URLs, and found that they are trivially bypassed by shortening a benign URL that turns malicious only a few moments after submitting it to the shortening service.","tags":null,"title":"The Long Story of Short URLs","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi","Stefano Zanero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1334534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591345282,"objectID":"895fc5afa70b9c64902bfb1ec9304236","permalink":"/publication/maggi_phdthesispaper_2012/","publishdate":"2012-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maggi_phdthesispaper_2012/","section":"publication","summary":"Our research concentrates on anomaly detection techniques, which have both industrial applications such as network monitoring and protection, as well as research applications such as software behavioral analysis or malware classification.

We first focused on the operating system, central to any computer, to avoid malicious code to subvert its normal activity. Secondly, we concentrated on web applications, which are the main interface to modern computing: Because of their immense popularity, they have indeed become the most targeted entry point of intrusions. Last, we developed novel techniques with the aim of identifying related events (e.g., alerts reported by intrusion detection systems) to build new and more compact knowledge to detect malicious activity on large-scale systems.

This leads to confusion and difficulty more for researchers than for practitioners for example, when comparing coverage of different antivirus engines, when integrating and systematizing known threats, or comparing the classifications given by different detectors. Clearly, solving naming inconsistencies is a very difficult task, as it requires that vendors agree on a unified naming convention. More importantly, solving inconsistencies is impossible without knowing exactly where they are. Therefore, in this paper we take a step back and concentrate on the problem of finding inconsistencies. To this end, we first represent each vendor's naming convention with a graph-based model. Second, we give a precise definition of inconsistency with respect to these models. Third, we define two quantitative measures to calculate the overall degree of inconsistency between vendors. In addition, we propose a fast algorithm that finds non-trivial (i.e., beyond syntactic differences) inconsistencies. Our experiments on four major antivirus vendors and 98,798 real-world malware samples confirm anecdotal observations that different vendors name viruses differently. More importantly, we were able to find inconsistencies that cannot be inferred at all by looking solely at the syntax.","tags":null,"title":"Finding Non-trivial Malware Naming Inconsistencies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi","Alberto Volpatto","Simone Gasparini","Giacomo Boracchi","Stefano Zanero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1323043200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591345282,"objectID":"3361970ef19794f83f7f9f6e15b3ab2d","permalink":"/publication/maggi_iclearshot_2011/","publishdate":"2011-12-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maggi_iclearshot_2011/","section":"publication","summary":"The pervasiveness of mobile devices increases the risk of exposing sensitive information on the go.

This feedback mechanism has been adopted by the top three touchscreen vendors (Apple iOS, Google Android, RIM BlackBerry); in newer version of these mobile OSs, the user has no way to disable it. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we implemented it against the iPhone (the most popular one), but it can be easily adapted to similar devices with minor modifications.  Our attack takes into account that, in real-world scenarios, both the victim's device and attacker's spying camera are not standing in fixed positions. To compensate their movements and misalignments, our system detects and rectifies the target screen before identifying keystokes. By doing that, we are able to automatically recognize up to 97.07% of the keystrokes, with as low as 1.15% errors and an average processing speed that makes it a fast and quasi-real-time alternative to shoulder surfing.","tags":null,"title":"iSnoop: How to Steal Secrets From Touchscreen Devices","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi","Alberto Volpatto","Simone Gasparini","Giacomo Boracchi","Stefano Zanero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1317427200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591345282,"objectID":"73a68315e693c62f18a6415bbb93076e","permalink":"/publication/maggi_iclearshotposter_2011/","publishdate":"2011-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maggi_iclearshotposter_2011/","section":"publication","summary":"Touchscreen devices increase the risk of shoulder surfing to such an extent that attackers could steal sensitive information by simply following the victim and observe his or her portable device.

The general approach is to record inbound calls received on decoy phone lines, place outbound calls to the same caller identifiers (when available) and also to telephone numbers obtained from different sources. Specifically, our system analyzes instant messages (e.g., automated social engineering attempts) and suspicious emails (e.g., spam, phishing), and extracts telephone numbers, URLs and popular words from the content. In addition, users can voluntarily submit voice phishing (vishing) attempts through a public website. Extracted telephone numbers, URLs and popular words will be correlated to recognize campaigns by means of cross-channel relationships between messages.","tags":["workshop"],"title":"A social-engineering-centric data collection initiative to study phishing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Volpatto","Federico Maggi","Stefano Zanero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1290384000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591345282,"objectID":"ab2e075dad953e19b6fa739ef600a7a8","permalink":"/publication/volpatto_cooperativeids_2010/","publishdate":"2010-11-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/volpatto_cooperativeids_2010/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Effective Multimodel Anomaly Detection Using Cooperative Negotiation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi","Stefano Zanero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1289433600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591348204,"objectID":"3591b0a5f32a1287a8cf693ea5c138d6","permalink":"/publication/maggi_cloudids_tr_2010/","publishdate":"2010-11-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maggi_cloudids_tr_2010/","section":"publication","summary":"The world of information and communication technology is experiencing changes that, regardless of some skepticism, are bringing to life the concept of ``utility computing''.

We conclude that, although only a minority of threats qualify as novel, they are well camouflaged and can be difficult to recognize behind the confusion caused by the cloud computing excitement.","tags":null,"title":"Rethinking security in a cloudy world","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi","Alberto Volpatto","Simone Gasparini","Giacomo Boracchi","Stefano Zanero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1288569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591348205,"objectID":"e9cbe926e7d84d90cddf45186e83b666","permalink":"/publication/maggi_iclearshot_tr_2010/","publishdate":"2010-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maggi_iclearshot_tr_2010/","section":"publication","summary":"Spying on a person is a subtle, yet easy and reliable method to obtain sensitive information. Even if the victim is well protected from digital attacks, spying may be a viable option. In addition, the pervasiveness of mobile devices increases an attacker's opportunities to observe the victims while they are accessing or entering sensitive information. This risk is exacerbated by the remarkable user-friendliness of modern, mobile graphical interfaces, which, for example, display visual feedback to improve the user experience and make common tasks, $ensuremathbackslashbackslash$eg, typing, more natural. Unfortunately, this turns into the well-known trade-off between usability and security. In this work, we focus on how usability of modern mobile interfaces may affect the users' privacy. In particular, we describe a practical eavesdropping attack, able to recognize the sequence of keystrokes from a low-resolution video, recorded while the victim is typing on a touchscreen. Our attack exploits the fact that modern virtual keyboards, as opposed to mechanical ones, often display magnified, virtual keys in predictable positions. To demonstrate the feasibility of this attack we implemented it against 2010's most popular smart-phone (i.e., Apple's iPhone). Our approach works under realistic conditions, because it tracks and rectifies the target screen according to the victim's natural movements, before performing the keystroke recognition. On real-world settings, our attack can automatically recognize up to 97.07% (91.03% on average) of the keystrokes, with a 1.15% error rate and a speed between 37 and 51 keystrokes per minute. This work confirms that touchscreen keyboards that magnify keys make automatic eavesdropping attacks easier than in classic mobile keyboards.","tags":null,"title":"Don't touch a word!

Typically, the phishers use simple technologies (e.g., e-mailing) to spread social engineering attacks with the goal of persuading a large amount of victims into voluntarily disclose sensitive data. Phishing based on e-mail and web technologies is certainly the most popular form. It has indeed received ample attention and some mitigation measures have been implemented. In this paper we describe our study on vishing (voice phishing), a form of phishing where the scammers exploit the phone channel to ask for sensitive information, rather than sending e-mails and cloning trustworthy websites. In some sense, the traditional ala-Mitnick phone scams are streamlined by attackers using techniques that are typical of modern, e-mail-based phishing. We detail our analysis of an embryonic, real-world database of vishing attacks reported by victims through a publicly-available web application that we build for this purpose. The vishing activity that we registered in our preliminary analysis is targeted against the U.S. customers. According to our samples, we analyzed to what extent the criminals rely on automated responders to streamline the vishing campaigns. In addition, we analyzed the content of the conversations and found that words such as 'credit', 'press' (a key) or 'account' are fairly popular. In addition, we describe the data collection infrastructure and motivate why gathering data about vishing is more difficult than for regular e-mail phishing.","tags":null,"title":"Are the Con Artists Back?

However, the effectiveness of this technique crucially depends upon both the quality and the completeness of the training data. Unfortunately, in most cases, the traffic to the system (e.g., a web application or daemon process) protected by an anomaly detector is not uniformly distributed. Therefore, some components (e.g., authentication, payments, or content publishing) might not be exercised enough to train an anomaly detection system in a reasonable time frame. This is of particular importance in real-world settings, where anomaly detection systems are deployed with little or no manual configuration, and they are expected to automatically learn the normal behavior of a system to detect or block attacks. In this work, we first demonstrate that the features utilized to train a learning-based detector can be semantically grouped, and that features of the same group tend to induce similar models. Therefore, we propose addressing local training data deficiencies by exploiting clustering techniques to construct a knowledge base of well-trained models that can be utilized in case of undertraining. Our approach, which is independent of the particular type of anomaly detector employed, is validated using the realistic case of a learning-based system protecting a pool of web servers running several web applications such as blogs, forums, or Web services. We run our experiments on a real-world data set containing over 58 million HTTP requests to more than 36,000 distinct web application components. The results show that by using the proposed solution, it is possible to achieve effective attack detection even with scarce training data.","tags":null,"title":"Effective Anomaly Detection with Scarce Training Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1267056000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591348035,"objectID":"05f87efc45600bc8955bffa9da815c28","permalink":"/talk/maggi_phdthesisfbk_talk_2010/","publishdate":"2010-02-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/maggi_phdthesisfbk_talk_2010/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Detecting Anomalous Behaviors in Computer Infrastructures","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1264032000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591348035,"objectID":"f7077810ab9a934a923746da6a7931c6","permalink":"/talk/maggi_justintime_talk_2010/","publishdate":"2010-01-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/maggi_justintime_talk_2010/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Just-in-Time Training of Anomaly Detectors","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591348228,"objectID":"14fb86e5d268463f617c428d20a7d9bb","permalink":"/publication/maggi_phdthesis_2010/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maggi_phdthesis_2010/","section":"publication","summary":"This dissertation details our research on anomaly detection techniques, that are central to several classic security-related tasks such as network monitoring, but it also have broader applications such as program behavior characterization or malware classification. In particular, we worked on anomaly detection from three different perspective, with the common goal of recognizing awkward activity on computer infrastructures. In fact, a computer system has several weak spots that must be protected to avoid attackers to take advantage of them. We focused on protecting the operating system, central to any computer, to avoid malicious code to subvert its normal activity. Secondly, we concentrated on protecting the web applications, which can be considered the modern, shared operating systems; because of their immense popularity, they have indeed become the most targeted entry point to violate a system. Last, we experimented with novel techniques with the aim of identifying related events (e.g., alerts reported by intrusion detection systems) to build new and more compact knowledge to detect malicious activity on large-scale systems.  Our contributions regarding host-based protection systems focus on characterizing a process' behavior through the system calls invoked into the kernel. In particular, we engineered and carefully tested different versions of a multi-model detection system using both stochastic and deterministic models to capture the features of the system calls during normal operation of the operating system. Besides demonstrating the effectiveness of our approaches, we confirmed that the use of finite-state, deterministic models allow to detect deviations from the process' control flow with the highest accuracy; however, our contribution combine this effectiveness with advanced models for the system calls' arguments resulting in a significantly decreased number of false alarms.  Our contributions regarding web-based protection systems focus on advanced training procedures to enable learning systems to perform well even in presence of changes in the web application source code---particularly frequent in the Web 2.0 era. We also addressed data scarcity issues that is a real problem when deploying an anomaly detector to protect a new, never-used-before application. Both these issues dramatically decrease the detection capabilities of an intrusion detection system but can be effectively mitigated by adopting the techniques we propose.  Last, we investigated the use of different stochastic and fuzzy models to perform automatic alert correlation, which is as post processing step to intrusion detection. We proposed a fuzzy model that formally defines the errors that inevitably occur if time-based alert aggregation (i.e., two alerts are considered correlated if they are close in time) is used. This model allow to account for measurements errors and avoid false correlations due to delays, for instance, or incorrect parameter settings. In addition, we defined a model to describe the alert generation as a stochastic process and experimented with non-parametric statistical tests to define robust, zero-configuration correlation systems.  The aforementioned tools have been tested over different datasets---that are thoroughly documented in this document---and lead to interesting results.","tags":null,"title":"Integrated Detection of Anomalous Behavior of Computer Infrastructures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Claudio Criscione","Federico Maggi","Guido Salvaneschi","Stefano Zanero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1257724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591345282,"objectID":"d57a53cb263242699dcc6679f60db467","permalink":"/publication/criscione_masibty_2009/","publishdate":"2009-11-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/criscione_masibty_2009/","section":"publication","summary":"Anomaly-based techniques were exploited successfully to implement protection mechanisms for various systems. Recently, these approaches have been ported to the web domain under the name of ``web application anomaly detectors'' (or firewalls) with promising results. In particular, those capable of automatically building specifications, or models, of the protected application by observing its traffic (e.g., network packets, system calls, or HTTP requests and responses) are particularly interesting, since they can be deployed with little effort. Typically, the detection accuracy of these systems is significantly influenced by the model building phase (often called training), which clearly depends upon the quality of the observed traffic, which should resemble the normal activity of the protected application and must be also free from attacks. Otherwise, detection may result in significant amounts of false positives (i.e., benign events flagged as anomalous) and negatives (i.e., undetected threats). In this work we describe Masibty, a web application anomaly detector that have some interesting properties. First, it requires the training data not to be attack-free. Secondly, not only it protects the monitored application, it also detects and blocks malicious client-side threats before they are sent to the browser. Third, Masibty intercepts the queries before they are sent to the database, correlates them with the corresponding HTTP requests and blocks those deemed anomalous. Both the accuracy and the performance have been evaluated on real-world web applications with interesting results. The system is almost not influenced by the presence of attacks in the training data and shows only a negligible amount of false positives, although this is paid in terms of a slight performance overhead.","tags":null,"title":"Integrated Detection of Attacks Against Browsers, Web Applications and Databases","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Maggi","Matteo Matteucci","Stefano Zanero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1254355200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591520876,"objectID":"66adefc2d7c874f842b068d068cfd544","permalink":"/publication/maggi_fuzzyalertaggregation_article_2009/","publishdate":"2009-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maggi_fuzzyalertaggregation_article_2009/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper we focus on the aggregation of IDS alerts, an important component of the alert fusion process.

The reason is that these systems are able to characterize the applications' normal behavior in an automated fashion.

These false positives need to be analyzed by the security officer who then has to interact with the web application developers to confirm that the reported alerts were indeed erroneous detections. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for the automatic detection of changes in web applications, which allows for the selective retraining of the affected anomaly detection models. We demonstrate that, by correctly identifying legitimate changes in web applications, we can reduce false positives and allow for the automated retraining of the anomaly models. We have evaluated our approach by analyzing a number of real-world applications. Our analysis shows that web applications indeed change substantially over time, and that our technique is able to effectively detect changes and automatically adapt the anomaly detection models to the new structure of the changed web applications.","tags":null,"title":"Protecting a Moving Target: Addressing Web Application Concept Drift","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alessandro Frossi","Federico Maggi","Gian Luigi Rizzo","Stefano Zanero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1247097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591345282,"objectID":"4c79fa588c41bca012e662af9cd43e20","permalink":"/publication/frossi_hybridsyscalls_2009/","publishdate":"2009-07-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frossi_hybridsyscalls_2009/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a syscall-based anomaly detection system that incorporates both deterministic and stochastic models.
