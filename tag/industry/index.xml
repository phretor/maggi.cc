      <title>The Role of Industrial Routers in Keeping the Future Factory Secure</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Industrial routers play a very crucial role: a single vulnerability can grant
the attacker access to an entire network of critical machines. In this
research, I&amp;rsquo;ve looked at how easy it is for a hypothetical attacker to find
and enumerate industrial routers, and the security posture of their vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial routers aren&amp;rsquo;t just regular routers in a rugged case. They are the
gateway to networks of &lt;em&gt;machines&lt;/em&gt;, which usually end up interacting with the
physical world. Think about connected vehicles, factories, robots, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While working on a remote access box (another name for &amp;ldquo;industrial router&amp;rdquo;),
during our 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://robosec.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;industrial robots research&lt;/a&gt;, we noticed that
the web-admin panel had an authentication-bypass vulnerability. Upon reporting
the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://websupport.ewon.biz/support/news/support/ewon-security-enhancement-fw-112s2-0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;vulnerability to the vendor, which patched it right
away&lt;/a&gt;,
we&amp;rsquo;ve wondered: are there other vendors? What&amp;rsquo;s the state of security in this
area?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After going through the &amp;ldquo;Switches Get Stitches&amp;rdquo; talks (
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slideshare.net/44Con/switches-getstitches&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;44CON 2014&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://media.ccc.de/v/31c3_-_6196_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201412281130_-_switches_get_stitches_-_eireann_leverett&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;31C3 2014&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urjKkQaspHQ&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Black Hat US 2015&lt;/a&gt;),
we had some bad feelings about industrial routers too, so we&amp;rsquo;ve started to
collect technical resources like manuals and firmware update files, and crafted
Shodan and Censys search strings to see how many of these routers were directly
exposed to a casual attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that we&amp;rsquo;ve noticed was the abundance of technical information
freely available to the public. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong: I&amp;rsquo;m not advocating in favor
of &amp;ldquo;security through obscurity&amp;rdquo; nor &amp;ldquo;closed source&amp;rdquo;. Once I believe in
openness, I also believe that critical targets like industrial routers (which
are put in front of supposedly critical machinery), shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; easy
for a casual attacker to discover. Ironically, marketing brochures required
a registration, whereas firmware and technical manuals were directly indexed by
search engines and publicly accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the security posture of some vendors, we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to take a broad look
at all of them, both from a reconnaissance and vulnerability viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
