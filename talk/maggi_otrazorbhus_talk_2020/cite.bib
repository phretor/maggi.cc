  abstract	= {In this talk, we delve into industrial robot programming,
		  focusing on the security issues arising from the design and
		  implementation choices of these platforms.
		  
		  Industrial robot manufacturers provide proprietary,
		  domain-specific programming languages to operate these
		  complex machines. Mostly focused on movement instructions,
		  such programming languages also provide access to low-level
		  system resources like files and network access, and some
		  even allow dynamic code loading. While useful, these
		  features can lead to unsafe programming patterns such as
		  input-validation vulnerabilities or malware-like
		  functionalities, especially if the underlying environment
		  provides no resource isolation like those found in modern
		  operating systems.
		  
		  After describing the technical features of the languages by
		  eight leading manufacturers, we'll share several cases of
		  vulnerable and malicious usage. We'll then present a static
		  code analyzer that we created and patented, to scan robotic
		  programs and discover unsafe code patterns. Our evaluation
		  on 50 automation programs show that unsafe patterns are
		  indeed found in real-world code, and that static source
		  code analysis is an effective defense tool in the short
		  term.
		  
		  We conclude by discussing the remediation steps that can be
		  adopted by developers and vendors to mitigate such issues
		  in the medium and long term.},
