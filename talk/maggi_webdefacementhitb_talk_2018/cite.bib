  abstract	= {Web defacement is the practice of altering a website after
		  its compromise. The altered pages, called defaced pages,
		  can negatively affect the reputation and business of the
		  victim. While investigating several campaigns, we observed
		  that the artifacts left by these attackers allow an expert
		  analyst to investigate their modus operandi and social
		  structure, and expand from single attacks to a group of
		  related incidents. However, manually performing such
		  analysis on millions of events is tedious, and poses
		  scalability challenges.
		  
		  From these observations, we conceived an automated system
		  that efficiently builds intelligence information out of raw
		  events. Our approach streamlines the analysts job by
		  automatically recognizing web campaigns, and assigning
		  meaningful textual labels to them. Applied to a
		  comprehensive dataset of 13 million incidents, our approach
		  allowed us to conduct what we believe been the first
		  large-scale investigation of this form. In addition, our
		  approach is meant to be adopted operationally by analysts
		  to identify live campaigns in the real world.
		  
		  We analyze the social structure of modern web attackers,
		  which includes lone individuals as well as actors that
		  cooperate in teams. We look into their motivations, and we
		  draw a parallel between the time line of word-shaping
		  events and web campaigns, which represent the evolution of
		  the interests and orientation of modern attackers.},
