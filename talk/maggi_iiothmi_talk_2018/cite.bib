  abstract	= {Despite the focus on future-generation equipment, legacy
		  industrial machines will continue to exist. In terms of
		  cybersecurity risks, what happens when these machines must
		  be connected? We've answered this question by taking a
		  close look at a previous-generation industrial robot, one
		  of the most widespread industrial machine, used practically
		  in every sector, including for manufacturing. Besides the
		  software vulnerabilities that we have found, which we
		  consider "natural" in embedded software, we focused on the
		  root cause of these vulnerabilities and we will discuss our
		  thoughts and practical recommendations with the audience.
		  We will provide a demo of what happens when an attacker
		  compromises an industrial robot, explaining how a software
		  flaw can go all the way down to affecting the quality of
		  the manufactured goods. Beyond robots, the entire factory
		  features more and more embedded systems, which are a
		  critical entry point for an external attacker, and thus
		  need to properly be secured.},
