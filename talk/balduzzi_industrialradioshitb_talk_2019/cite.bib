  abstract	= {Radio-frequency (RF) remote controllers are widely used in
		  multiple industrial applications like manufacturing,
		  construction and transportation. Cranes, drillers and
		  diggers, among others, are commonly equipped with RF
		  controllers, which have become the weakest link in
		  safety-critical IIoT applications.
		  
		  Our security assessment revealed a lack of important
		  security features at different levels, with vendors using
		  obscure proprietary protocols instead of standards. As a
		  consequence, this technology appeared to be vulnerable to
		  attacks like replay, command injection, e-stop abuse,
		  malicious repairing and reprogramming. Together with ZDI,
		  we ran into a 6-months responsible disclosure process and
		  then released 10 security advisories.
		  
		  In this presentation, we share the findings of our research
		  and make use of demos to discuss the problems in detail. We
		  conclude providing recommendations for all parties involved
		  in the life-cycle of these devices, from vendors to users
		  and system integrators.},
