  abstract	= {RFQuack is the versatile RF-analysis tool that quacks!
		  It's a library firmware that allows you to sniff,
		  manipulate, and transmit data over the air. And if you're
		  not happy how the default firmware functionalities, we made
		  it easy to extend. Consider it as the hardware-modular and
		  developer-friendly version of the great YardStick One,
		  which is based on the CC1111 radio chip. Differently from
		  that and other RF dongles, RFQuack is designed to be
		  agnostic with respect to the radio chip. So if you want to
		  use, say, the RF69, you can do it. If you need to use the
		  CC110L or CC1120, you can do it. Similarly to RFCat,
		  RFQuack has console based, Python scriptable, client that
		  allows you to set parameters, receive, transmit, and so
		  on.},
