  abstract	= {MQTT and CoAP provide data connectivity for practically
		  any kind of "machines". This talk will cover the results of
		  our security analysis of MQTT and CoAP, which uncovered
		  issues in the design specifications, vulnerable product
		  implementations, and hundreds of thousands unsecured,
		  open-to-the-world deployments. Despite the fixes in the
		  design specifications, it is hard for developers to keep up
		  with a changing standard when a technology becomes
		  pervasive. Also, the market of this technology is very wide
		  because the barrier to entry is fairly low. This led to a
		  multitude of fragmented implementations. Our findings have
		  been acknowledged by the vendors, by the MQTT Technical
		  Committee, which released a note to help identify the
		  risks, and received the attention of several other
		  organizations. Using MQTT and CoAP as case study, we will
		  provide recommendations at various levels, in the hope to
		  see a significant reduction in the number of insecure
		  deployments in the future.},
