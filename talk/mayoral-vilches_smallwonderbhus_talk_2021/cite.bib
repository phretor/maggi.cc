  abstract	= {Security in robotics is nothing really new if one
		  considers modern OT and IT approaches, and most security
		  practices translate directly to robots. However, there's
		  almost no security culture amongst robot makers.
		  
		  Building a robot requires careful selection of components
		  that interact across networks while meeting timing
		  deadlines. It isn't uncommon for robot components to be
		  compromised or fail over time, leading to complete system
		  malfunction. Given the expensive prices of these machines
		  (we focus on robots in the 25K-70K USD range), it's only
		  reasonable to consider the need for securing and repairing
		  robots.
		  
		  We introduce and promote systematic "robot teardown" as an
		  approach to repair robots by understanding their internals
		  (still obscure). Needless to say, robot teardown is an
		  essential practice in robot security. We show several
		  "tricks from the trade" and the legal implications learned
		  by porting reverse-engineering practices into the
		  less-explored field of robotics. We explain how we a)
		  discovered more than 90 security vulnerabilities in robots
		  from Teradyne (MiR and UR) over a period of two years
		  (never discussed publicly before), b) gained repairing
		  capabilities on these robots, c) show evidence of planned
		  obsolescence by comparing two sequentially released robot
		  controllers, and d) demonstrate how robot hacking leads us
		  to repurpose an older controller (previous version) from
		  Universal Robots with their newer robots (arms) maintaining
		  full capabilities and demonstrating that there's no need to
		  re-spend thousands of dollars again.
		  
		  Similar to Ford in the 1920s with cars, most robot
		  manufacturers nowadays employ planned obsolescence
		  practices and organize dealers and system integrators into
		  "private networks", providing repair parts only to
		  "certified" companies to make repairs more difficult and
		  evade competition. We wrap up by advocating for a "Right to
		  Repair'' in robotics to reduce robot e-waste and promote
		  systematic teardowns for the benefit of security
		  research.},
