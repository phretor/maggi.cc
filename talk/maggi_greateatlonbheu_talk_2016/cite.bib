  abstract	= {While we have grown accustomed to stealthy malware,
		  specifically written to gain and maintain control of the
		  victim machines to abuse their resources, ransomware really
		  comes as a "plot twist"! After 10+ years of stealthy
		  malware, spread mainly for building botnets and steal
		  information, for the second time we're witnessing a growth
		  of disruptive malware, and an interest for direct and fast
		  profit. Ransomware is a particularly striking example of
		  disruptive malware, both on mobile and desktop targets:
		  While traditional mass malware must fly under the radar to
		  fulfill its goals, a ransomware attack that remains
		  unaccountable has failed miserably. It must show up to
		  inform and frighten the victim! As a result, the human
		  psychological response to the attack plays a significant
		  role in the success of ransomware schemes. And, given the
		  remarkable revenue, the scheme seems to be working fairly
		  well.
		  
		  This talk will describe the technical impact of disruptive
		  malware and its game-changing approach, which made us (at
		  least) rethink our incident-response plans. We will focus
		  on mobile ransomware as a representative, extreme case
		  study. Albeit not very studied, we are currently tracking
		  10 distinct families, and collected tenths of thousands
		  distinct samples in three months. In this talk, we will go
		  through the most notorious families such as Koler, SLocker,
		  Svpeng (and mention the other notable ones), overviewing
		  their social-engineering tricks and how they are
		  technically implemented. This will include, for instance,
		  how an app can effectively lock a device to forcefully
		  display the typical threatening message that informs the
		  victim of what just happened, or how crypto and file-system
		  APIs are (ab)used to surreptitiously encrypt the valuable
		  data.
		  
		  After having overviewed these aspects, we will describe how
		  they can be effectively detected with specific static
		  features. We will present a lightweight Smali emulator to
		  track the instruction sequences that implement
		  device-locking mechanisms. To detect malicious encryption
		  attempts, we will present a static, dataflow-based
		  program-analysis technique and tool that track file-system
		  operations (e.g., file listing, file reading) to determine
		  if they are "connected" to encryption flows. Since the most
		  recent families have started to abuse the
		  device-administration API (e.g., to lock the device),
		  obfuscated method names and reflection to hinder automatic
		  static analysis, we will show a couple of counter-tricks.
		  Last, we will show how the threatening messages can be
		  recognized from normal text using a language-analysis
		  technique, which classifies text based on the appearance of
		  key terms frequently found in ransomware samples but not in
		  benign sources. Since static program-analysis approaches
		  like ours can be time and resource consuming, we describe a
		  fast triaging pre-filtering technique to quickly discard
		  strikingly benign applications. This filter is generic and
		  ransomware-agnostic. Thus, in principle, it could be
		  applied to any app-vetting pipeline.
		  
		  With this talk we will release the source code of a
		  prototype that implements (part of) the described
		  techniques, and a dataset comprising tenths of thousands of
		  ransomware applications targeting the Android platform,
		  each labeled with the set of features that characterize
		  their statically-extracted behavior.},
