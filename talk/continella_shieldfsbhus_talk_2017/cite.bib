  abstract	= {Preventive and reactive security measures can only
		  partially mitigate the damage caused by modern ransomware
		  attacks. The remarkable amount of illicit profit and the
		  cybercriminals' increasing interest in ransomware schemes
		  demonstrate that current defense solutions are failing, and
		  a large number of users are actually paying the ransoms. In
		  fact, pure-detection approaches (e.g., based on analysis
		  sandboxes or pipelines) are not sufficient, because, when
		  luck allows a sample to be isolated and analyzed, it is
		  already too late for several users! Moreover, modern
		  ransomware implements several techniques to prevent
		  detection by common AV. Similarly, for performance reasons,
		  backups leave a small-but-important window of recent files
		  unprotected.
		  
		  We believe that a forward-looking solution is to equip
		  modern operating systems with generic, practical
		  self-healing capabilities against this serious threat.
		  
		  In this talk, we will present ShieldFS, a drop-in driver
		  that makes the Windows native filesystem immune to
		  ransomware attacks, even when detection fails ShieldFS
		  dynamically toggles a protection layer that acts as a
		  copy-on-write mechanism whenever its detection component
		  reveals suspicious activity. For this, ShieldFS monitors
		  the filesystem's internals to update a set of adaptive
		  models that profile the system activity over time. This
		  detection is based on a study of the filesystem activity of
		  over 2,245 applications, and takes into account the entropy
		  of write operations, frequency of read, write, and
		  folder-listing operations, fraction of files renamed, and
		  the file-type usage statistics. Additionally, ShieldFS
		  monitors the memory pages of each "potentially malicious"
		  process, searching for traces of the typical block cipher
		  key schedules.
		  
		  We will show how ShieldFS can shadow the write operations.
		  Whenever one or more processes violate our detection
		  component, their operations are deemed malicious and the
		  side effects on the filesystem are transparently rolled
		  back.
		  
		  Last, we will demo how effective ShieldFS is against
		  samples from state of the art ransomware families, showing
		  that it is able to detect the malicious activity at runtime
		  and transparently recover all the original files.},
