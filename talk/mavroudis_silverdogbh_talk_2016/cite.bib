  abstract	= {Cross-device tracking (XDT) technologies are currently the
		  ``Holy Grail'' for marketers because they allow to track
		  the user's visited content across different devices to then
		  push relevant, more targeted content. For example, if a
		  user clicks on a particular advertisement while browsing
		  the web at home, the advertisers are very interested in
		  collecting this information to display, later on, related
		  advertisements on other devices belonging to the same user
		  (e.g., phone, tablet).
		  
		  Currently, the most recent innovation in this area is
		  ultrasonic cross-device tracking (uXDT), which is the use
		  of the ultrasonic spectrum as a communication channel to
		  "pair" devices for the aforementioned tracking purposes.
		  Technically, this pairing happens through a receiver
		  application installed on the phone or tablet. The business
		  model is that users will receive rewards or useful services
		  for keeping those apps active, pretty much like it happens
		  for proximity-marketing apps (e.g., Shopkick), where users
		  receive deals for walk-ins recorded by their
		  indoor-localizing apps.
		  
		  This talk will describe and demonstrate the practical
		  security and privacy risks that arise with the adoption of
		  uXDT-enabled systems. The uXDT technology has caught the
		  attention of major companies (e.g., IDG Ventures, Google,
		  Nestle, Dominos), many of which either invested in uXDT
		  providers (e.g., SilverPush, Signal360, Audible Magic), or
		  approached such companies as clients. Unfortunately,
		  unbeknownst to the users, we found that numerous mobile
		  applications, some with millions of downloads, include uXDT
		  advertising frameworks that actively listen for
		  ultrasounds, with no opt-out option for the users! Security
		  experts and the authorities (e.g., the Federal Trade
		  Commission) have promptly raised concerns about uXDT, but
		  until now no comprehensive security analysis of the
		  technology has been released.
		  
		  In this talk, we will explore the uXDT ecosystem, dig into
		  the inner workings of popular uXDT frameworks, and perform
		  an in-depth technical analysis of the underlying
		  technology, exposing both implementation & design
		  vulnerabilities, and critical security & privacy
		  shortcomings that we discovered. In the offensive part of
		  our talk, we will demonstrate (through practical demo
		  sessions) how an attacker can exploit uXDT frameworks to
		  reveal the true IP addresses of users who browse the
		  Internet through anonymity networks (e.g., VPNs or Tor).
		  Moreover, we will describe how an attacker can tamper with
		  the "pairing" process or affect the results of the
		  advertising/bidding algorithms. For example, an attacker
		  equipped with a simple beacon-emitting device (e.g., a
		  smartphone) can walk into a Starbucks at peak hour and
		  launch a profile-corruption attack against all customers
		  currently taking advantage of uXDT-enabled apps.
		  
		  In the defensive part of our talk, we will introduce three
		  countermeasures that we designed, implemented, and will
		  publicly release. These include (1) a mobile application
		  that detects ultrasound beacons "in the air" with the goal
		  of raising awareness, (2) a browser extension that acts as
		  a personal firewall by selectively filtering ultrasonic
		  beacons, and (3) an brand-new OS permission control in
		  Android that allows applications to declaratively ask
		  access to the ultrasound spectrum. We will go into the
		  technical details and provide remediation advice useful
		  both for the users and developers.},
