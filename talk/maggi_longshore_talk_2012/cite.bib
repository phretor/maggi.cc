  abstract	= {I gave a talk based on these slides for the first time at
		  Royal Holloway University of London, in April 2012. This
		  talk discusses the results of a research that we have
		  conducted about the impact on users of short URLs. I
		  describe a system that we designed, implemented, and
		  deployed that observes and collects the short URLs that
		  more than 7,000 real web users have encountered while
		  browsing the Web between March 2010 and April 2011 (and
		  counting). On this dataset, which comprises 16,075,693
		  distinct short URLs, we first precisely characterized the
		  usage habits observed during our collection process, and
		  the content typically referred by short URLs: Users exhibit
		  different usage habits depending on the type of content
		  they are using short URLs for. We then analyzed the abuse
		  of short URLs to hide the true URL of malicious pages: This
		  practice is not widespread, although we noticed that the
		  miscreants tend to post the same malicious short URL on
		  multiple pages. Finally, we analyzed the countermeasures of
		  shortening services against abuses of short URLs, and found
		  that they are trivially bypassed by shortening a benign URL
		  that turns malicious only a few moments after submitting it
		  to the shortening service.},
