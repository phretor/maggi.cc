  abstract	= {Spying on a person is an easy and effective method to
		  obtain sensitive informations, even when the victim is well
		  protected against common digital attacks. Modern mobile
		  devices allow people to perform some information sensitive
		  actions in unsafe places, where anyone could easily observe
		  the victim while typing. What if your mobile phone has a
		  cool touchscreen interface that gives you graphical
		  feedback as you type (iPhone, Android, BlackBerry Torch)?
		  Does it make shoulder surfing easier or, worse,
		  automatable?
		  
		  We believe so, and to demonstrate it, we developed a
		  practical shoulder surfing attack that automatically
		  reconstructs the sequence of keystrokes by aiming a camera
		  at the target touchscreen while the victim is typing. Our
		  attack exploits feedback such as magnified keys, often
		  appearing in predictable positions. This feedback mechanism
		  has been adopted by the top three touchscreen vendors
		  (Apple iOS, Google Android, RIM BlackBerry); in newer
		  version of these mobile OSs, the user has no way to disable
		  it. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we
		  implemented it against the iPhone (the most popular one),
		  but it can be easily adapted to similar devices with minor
		  modifications.
		  
		  Our attack takes into account that, in real-world
		  scenarios, both the victim's device and attacker's spying
		  camera are not standing in fixed positions. To compensate
		  their movements and misalignments, our system detects and
		  rectifies the target screen before identifying keystokes.
		  By doing that, we are able to automatically recognize up to
		  97.07% of the keystrokes, with as low as 1.15% errors and
		  an average processing speed that makes it a fast and
		  quasi-real-time alternative to shoulder surfing.},
