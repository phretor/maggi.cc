  abstract	= {Modern botnets rely on domain-generation algorithms (DGAs)
		  to build resilient command-and-control infrastructures.
		  Recent works focus on recognizing automatically generated
		  domains (AGDs) from DNS traffic, which potentially allows
		  to identify previously unknown AGDs to hinder or disrupt
		  botnets' communication capabilities. The state-of-the-art
		  approaches require to deploy low-level DNS sensors to
		  access data whose collection poses practical and privacy
		  issues, making their adoption problematic. We propose a
		  mechanism that overcomes the above limitations by analyzing
		  DNS traffic data through a combination of linguistic and
		  IP-based features of suspicious domains. In this way, we
		  are able to identify AGD names, characterize their DGAs and
		  isolate logical groups of domains that represent the
		  respective botnets. Moreover, our system enriches these
		  groups with new, previously unknown AGD names, and produce
		  novel knowledge about the evolving behavior of each tracked
		  botnet. We used our system in real-world settings, to help
		  researchers that requested intelligence on suspicious
		  domains and were able to label them as belonging to the
		  correct botnet automatically. Additionally, we ran an
		  evaluation on 1,153,516 domains, including AGDs from both
		  modern (e.g., Bamital) and traditional (e.g., Conficker,
		  Torpig) botnets. Our approach correctly isolated families
		  of AGDs that belonged to distinct DGAs, and set
		  automatically generated from non-automatically generated
		  domains apart in 94.8 percent of the cases.},
