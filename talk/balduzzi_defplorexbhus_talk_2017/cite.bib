  abstract	= {The security industry as a whole---including operation
		  centers, providers and telcos---loves collecting data.
		  Researchers are not different! A sort of common feeling is
		  that the more data someone collects, the more
		  self-confident he becomes about, say, a threat or another
		  phenomenon. However, large volumes of data imply more
		  processing resources needed, especially in extracting
		  meaningful and useful information if the data is highly
		  unstructured. As a result, manual data analysis is often
		  the only choice, with security professionals like
		  pen-testers, reversers and analysts processing data through
		  tedious repetitive operations.
		  
		  Given this situation, and our research lab suffering from
		  similar problems, we have spent the first half of 2017
		  implementing a flexible toolkit based on open-source
		  libraries for efficiently analyzing millions of deface
		  pages and web incidents. Our tool, DefPloreX, uses a
		  combination of machine-learning and visualization
		  techniques to practically turn original unstructured data
		  into meaningful high-level descriptions. Real-time
		  information on incidents, breaches, attacks and
		  vulnerabilities, for example, are efficiently processed and
		  condensed into objects that are easily browsable -- making
		  them suitable for efficient large-scale eCrime forensics
		  and investigations.
		  
		  DefPloreX ingests plain CSV inputs about web incidents to
		  analyze, explores their resources with headless browsers,
		  extracts features from deface pages, and uploads the
		  resulting data to an Elastic index. Distributed headless
		  browsers are coordinated via Celery. Using Python Panda,
		  NumPy and PyTables, DefPloreX provides offline "views" of
		  the data, allowing easy pivoting and exploration. Our
		  toolkit automatically groups similar deface pages in
		  clusters and organizes web incidents in campaigns.
		  Requiring only one pass, clustering is intrinsically
		  parallel and not memory bound. DefPloreX offers text- and
		  web-based UIs, which can be queried using a simple language
		  for investigations and forensics.},
