  abstract	= {Two popular machine-to-machine (M2M) protocols—MQTT &
		  CoAP—are slowly forming the backbone of many IoT
		  infrastructures, including critical industry environments.
		  They are used to provide data connectivity for practically
		  any kind of "machines". We found out that these protocols
		  are affected by security and privacy issues that impact
		  several market verticals, applications, products, and
		  brands.
		  
		  This talk provides a security analysis of MQTT & CoAP at
		  the design, implementation, and deployment level. We found
		  issues in the design specifications, vulnerable product
		  implementations, and hundreds of thousands unsecured,
		  open-to-the-world deployments. These issues show the risk
		  that endpoints could be open to denial-of-service attacks
		  and, in some cases, full control by an adversary. Despite
		  the fixes in the design specifications, it is hard for
		  developers to keep up with a changing standard when a
		  technology becomes pervasive. Also, the market of this
		  technology is very wide because the barrier to entry is
		  fairly low. This led to a multitude of fragmented
		  implementations.
		  
		  We analyzed the source code of the most common MQTT
		  implementations, and discovered common flaws—mostly
		  originating from misinterpretation of the standard. In
		  particular, we found issues in how multibyte strings, UTF-8
		  characters, and regular-expressions are parsed. Combined
		  with standard features that force servers to retain
		  messages and clients to request acknowledgement the
		  delivery of every message, such bugs can lead to persistent
		  denial of service. Our findings have been acknowledged by
		  the MQTT Technical Committee, which released a note to help
		  identify the risks.
		  
		  Alongside this, we've analyzed hundreds of millions MQTT &
		  CoAP messages obtained from hundreds of thousands server.
		  Despite previous efforts that tried to raise awareness, we
		  still found exposed data related to various industry
		  sectors and sensitive information, including credentials
		  and network infrastructure details. Moreover, we found out
		  that MQTT is being used beyond messaging, to transport
		  binary data, most likely for OTA update purposes, which
		  certainly raises a red flag.
		  
		  Using MQTT & CoAP as a concrete example of modern M2M
		  technology, we will provide recommendations at various
		  levels (standardization bodies, vendors, developers, and
		  users) in the hope to see a significant reduction in the
		  number of insecure deployments in the future, and a more
		  responsible position by standardization bodies.},
