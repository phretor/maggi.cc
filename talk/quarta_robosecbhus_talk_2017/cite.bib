  abstract	= {Industrial robots are complex cyber-physical systems used
		  for manufacturing, and a critical component of any modern
		  factory. These robots aren't just electromechanical devices
		  but include complex embedded controllers, which are often
		  interconnected with other computers in the factory network,
		  safety systems, and to the Internet for remote monitoring
		  and maintenance. In this scenario, industrial routers also
		  play a key role, because they directly expose the robot's
		  controller. Therefore, the impact of a single, simple
		  vulnerability can grant attackers an easy entry point.
		  
		  Industrial robots must follow three fundamental laws:
		  accurately "read" from the physical world through sensors
		  and "write" (i.e. perform actions) through actuators,
		  refuse to execute self-damaging control logic, and most
		  importantly, echoing Asimov, never harm humans. By
		  combining a set of vulnerabilities we discovered on a real
		  robot, we will demonstrate how remote attackers are able to
		  violate such fundamental laws up to the point where they
		  can alter the manufactured product, physically damage the
		  robot, steal industry secrets, or injure humans.
		  
		  We will cover in-depth technical aspects (e.g., reverse
		  engineering and vulnerability details, and attack PoCs),
		  alongside a broader discussion on the security posture of
		  industrial routers and robots: Why these devices are
		  attractive for attackers? What could they achieve? Are they
		  hard to compromise? How can their security be improved?},
